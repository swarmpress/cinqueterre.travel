        "The story begins in the **terraces**. Every inch of soil was earned, carved out of the rock to plant grapevines and olive trees. This is why wine here is not just a drink; it is the village's primary currency of labor.",
        "Then there is the **sea**. Because the village was poor and the work was hard, the food became simple. Fish is served with little more than a squeeze of lemon and a drizzle of the oil pressed from those hillside groves.",
        "You will notice that **menus are short**. This is not a lack of choice, but a commitment to the day. If the sea was rough, there is no sea bass.",
        "Meals here follow the **rhythm of work**. A quick cone of fried fish at midday to keep moving, and a long, slow dinner as the sun dips behind the village."
