      "content": "After decades studying these ancient streets, I've learned that Monterosso reveals its secrets to those who understand its layers of history. The village developed in three phases: the Roman coastal settlement, the medieval hilltop expansion, and the modern beachfront district.\n\n**The Underground Passage**: Few visitors discover the tunnel connecting Old and New Town, built through the base of the medieval Aurora tower. This 19th-century engineering marvel saved the village from being split permanently by the rocky promontory.\n\n**Reading the Architecture**: Notice how building styles change as you move inland from the coast. The pastel houses near the harbor follow Genoese merchant traditions, while structures higher up reflect monastic influence from the Benedictine period.\n\n**Ancient Pathways**: The Via dell'Amore may be closed, but Monterosso offers equally stunning alternatives. The Sentiero Azzurro coastal trail to Vernazza follows ancient mule paths used by merchants for centuries. Look for carved stone markers indicating distances to neighboring villages.\n\n**Sacred Geography**: The placement of churches and shrines follows medieval spiritual logic. San Giovanni Battista faces the sea to bless fishermen, while the Santuario di Soviore commands the hilltops, protecting travelers on ancient pilgrim routes.",

        {
          "question": "How do I move between Old Town and the beach area?",
          "answer": "Three options: the scenic 10-minute coastal walk along Via Fegina, the underground tunnel through Aurora tower (look for the entrance near the train station), or the elevated pathway with spectacular views. The tunnel is fastest; the coastal route is most pleasant."
        },
        {
          "question": "Where can I find the best viewpoints for photography?",
          "answer": "Torre Aurora restaurant offers the highest accessible viewpoint. For free alternatives, climb to the Santuario di Soviore (30 minutes uphill) or take the trail toward Vernazza for dramatic coastal shots. Early morning light is magical from the San Francesco monastery terrace."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the difference between the two beaches?",
          "answer": "Fegina Beach (New Town) is larger with beach clubs, umbrellas, and restaurants like Miky. The Old Town beach is smaller, more authentic, frequented by locals and fishing boats. Both have the same crystal-clear water and views."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I reach the famous lemon terraces?",
          "answer": "Take the Sentiero Rosso (Red Trail) from behind the cemetery. The terraces are still working farms - respect private property and don't pick fruit. Best views are from the trail to Soviore sanctuary, about 45 minutes of steady climbing."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is it better to stay in Old Town or near the beach?",
          "answer": "Old Town for authentic atmosphere, narrow streets, and proximity to historic sites. Beach area for luxury hotels, easier luggage transport, and immediate beach access. Both are connected by a pleasant 5-minute walk."
        },
        {
          "question": "What should I know about the working harbor area?",
          "answer": "The harbor still functions as a fishing port - respect working boats and nets. Boat tours depart from the main pier. The fish market operates early morning (6-8 AM) when boats return. Evening aperitivo spots offer the best harbor views."
