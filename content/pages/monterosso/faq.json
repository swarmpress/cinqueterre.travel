        {
          "question": "What's the best way to get to Monterosso from other Cinque Terre villages?",
          "answer": "The regional train is your most reliable option, running every 15-30 minutes during peak season (April-October). From Riomaggiore, it's 8 minutes; from Manarola, 6 minutes; from Corniglia, 4 minutes; from Vernazza, just 3 minutes. Purchase tickets at station machines or use the Cinque Terre Card. Pro tip: validate your ticket before boarding or face a €25 fine. Ferries operate March-October from Monterosso to Vernazza (10 minutes) and other villages, offering stunning coastal views."
        },
        {
          "question": "Where should I eat in Monterosso for the best seafood experience?",
          "answer": "For luxury dining with spectacular sea views, book a terrace table at Ristorante Miky (Via Fegina 104) - their crudo di ricciola and risotto ai frutti di mare are exceptional. Torre Aurora offers panoramic Cinque Terre views from its historic tower setting, perfect for sunset cocktails. For authentic farm-to-table dining, try Ristorante Ciak where the chef grows organic ingredients in his own gardens. Reserve terrace tables at Miky and Torre Aurora well in advance, especially for sunset dining."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the difference between Old Town and New Town in Monterosso?",
          "answer": "Old Town (Centro Storico) features medieval streets, the Gothic San Giovanni Battista church, and traditional restaurants clustered around the historic harbor. New Town (Fegina) offers the main sandy beach, modern hotels, and beachfront restaurants like Ristorante Miky. The areas are connected by a 15-minute coastal walk through a tunnel carved into the cliff. Most luxury accommodations are in New Town for beach access, while Old Town provides authentic village atmosphere and easier train station access."
        },
        {
          "question": "When is the best time to visit Monterosso for good weather and fewer crowds?",
          "answer": "Late April to early June and September to mid-October offer the perfect balance of pleasant weather (18-25°C) and manageable crowds. July-August see temperatures reaching 28°C with peak tourist numbers - book accommodations 3-4 months ahead. November-March brings cooler weather (10-15°C) with many restaurants closed, but peaceful village atmosphere and dramatic winter seas. For hiking, September-October provides ideal conditions with clear views and comfortable temperatures."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I drive to Monterosso and where can I park?",
          "answer": "Yes, but parking is extremely limited and expensive (€2-3 per hour, €20-25 daily). The main parking area is Loreto Car Park above New Town, requiring a steep 10-minute walk down. Book parking online in advance during peak season. Many visitors park in La Spezia (€1 per hour) and take the 8-minute train to Monterosso. For luxury stays, some hotels offer private parking - confirm when booking. The village center is entirely car-free with narrow medieval streets accessible only on foot."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are the must-see attractions in Monterosso beyond the beaches?",
          "answer": "The 14th-century San Giovanni Battista church features stunning Gothic architecture and houses precious religious art. The Giant statue (Il Gigante) carved into the cliff offers dramatic photo opportunities and represents Neptune. Aurora Tower provides panoramic views and houses the excellent Torre Aurora restaurant. The Convent of the Capuchin Friars contains Van Dyck paintings and peaceful gardens. For hiking enthusiasts, the Monterosso-Vernazza coastal trail (Blue Trail) offers spectacular clifftop views - currently requires Cinque Terre Card (€7.50 daily)."

      "content": "**Transportation Essentials**: The Monterosso train station is in Old Town, making it convenient for exploring the historic center. Regional trains connect all five villages every 15-30 minutes during high season. Purchase the Cinque Terre Card for unlimited train travel and hiking trail access.\n\n**Accommodation Strategy**: Book beachfront hotels in New Town for luxury stays with sea access, or choose Old Town for authentic village atmosphere. Popular properties like Hotel Porto Roca and Villa Steno fill up months in advance for summer dates.\n\n**Dining Reservations**: Top restaurants require advance booking, especially for terrace seating. Call directly rather than relying on online systems. Most restaurants close on one weekday - check before planning your dining schedule.\n\n**Beach Access**: The main beach in New Town is free with public facilities. Private beach clubs offer umbrella and chair rentals (€20-30 daily) with bar service. The smaller Old Town beach is more intimate but gets crowded by midday.\n\n**Weather Considerations**: Sea conditions can affect ferry services - have train backup plans. Summer afternoon thunderstorms are common but brief. Pack layers as coastal temperatures vary throughout the day.\n\n**Money Matters**: Many small establishments prefer cash. ATMs are available but can run out during peak season. Budget €15-25 for casual lunch, €40-80 for dinner at recommended restaurants.",
