          "description": "Geography explains everything. Monterosso occupies the widest bay, the most level terrain, the most protected harbor. Where other villages cling to vertical cliffs, Monterosso has room to spread. This attracted more settlement, more development, eventually resort infrastructure. The difference isn't human choice—it's what the land allowed.",

          "description": "Absolutely. Monterosso's train station connects to all other villages in 4-12 minutes. You have the best infrastructure for return—beaches to relax after exploring, restaurants to dine after hiking. The position works. Many travelers base themselves here and day-trip elsewhere, returning to superior facilities each evening.",

        "**Beach clubs worth it?** The stabilimenti charge for umbrellas and chairs (around 20-30 euros per day), but include amenities: bathroom access, sometimes food service, often better maintained sand areas. For day-trippers, public beach is fine. For longer stays, clubs add comfort.",
        "**When to swim?** Early morning for calm water and empty beach. Late afternoon for warm water and golden light. Midday heat drives everyone underwater anyway. The water temperature peaks in August but remains swimmable May through October.",
        "**Swimming elsewhere?** The beaches are Monterosso's gift, but boat tours access hidden coves if you want variety. Rocky platforms exist at the old town harbor for those who prefer."

For anchovy specialties: ask locals which processor's family has a connected restaurant this season.",

The 1966 flood broke the statue's arms. What remains still guards the beach—an unintentional monument to both ambition and destruction. Best viewed from the water or the beach at sunset.",

For tours and tastings, contact the local agricultural cooperatives. Limoncello made from these specific lemons appears in every shop—but the real thing comes from families who still cultivate.",
          "giuliaComment": "The commercial limoncello is fine but generic. If you want the real Monterosso experience, ask at old town shops for homemade versions. Small batches, real lemons, prices that reflect actual agriculture. That's worth finding.",
