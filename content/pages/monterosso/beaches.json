      "content": "Unlike the dramatic cliff-hugging beaches of its sister villages, Monterosso unfolds like a Riviera dream. Here, golden sand meets your feet instead of smooth stones, and the beach stretches wide enough for proper lounging, not just quick dips between train connections.\n\nThe magic lies in the contrast: ancient red cliffs (the 'Mons Rubeus' that gives the village its name) frame modern beach clubs where you can sip Sciacchetrà while watching fishing boats return with the day's catch. This is where Romans once built their summer villas, and you'll understand why within moments of settling onto the warm sand.\n\nTiming is everything here. Arrive before 9 AM to claim your perfect spot and witness the morning light painting those famous red cliffs. The afternoon brings a golden hour that lasts for hours, when the Mediterranean becomes a mirror reflecting centuries of stories."

        {
          "question": "When is the best time to visit Monterosso's beaches?",
          "answer": "May through September offers the warmest water and longest days, but April and October provide fewer crowds with still-pleasant swimming. Arrive before 9 AM or after 4 PM to avoid peak sun and secure the best spots."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need to pay for beach access?",
          "answer": "No, all beaches have free public areas. However, premium beach clubs (stabilimenti) charge €15-30 per day for umbrellas, loungers, and facilities. The investment is worth it for comfort and convenience during peak season."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the difference between Fegina and Old Town beaches?",
          "answer": "Fegina Beach (New Town) is larger with more facilities and beach clubs, while Old Town Beach offers a more intimate setting with traditional fishing boats. Both have excellent swimming, but Fegina has better amenities for full-day lounging."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I reach the hidden beaches without a boat?",
          "answer": "Some secluded spots like Canneto Beach require boat access or challenging coastal hikes. Local boat tours cost €30-50 per person and include multiple coves. The adventure is part of the experience."
        },
        {
          "question": "What should I bring for a perfect beach day?",
          "answer": "Reef-safe sunscreen (mandatory), water shoes for rocky areas, a waterproof bag, and cash for beach clubs. Don't forget a good book—these beaches are made for lingering."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is swimming safe year-round?",
          "answer": "The swimming season runs April through October, with water temperatures reaching 24°C (75°F) in summer. Monterosso's protected bay makes it the safest swimming in Cinque Terre, even during shoulder seasons."
