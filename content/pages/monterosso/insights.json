        "**The divide is physical**. Aurora Tower separates the two neighborhoods—medieval fortification become modern boundary. The tunnel carved through it in the 19th century connected what had been separated. Today, both sides claim Monterosso identity equally.",
        "**Old town kept the heritage**. The caruggi, the church, the fishing traditions, the dialect—old town preserves what Cinque Terre looked like before tourists arrived. Families here trace their lineage through centuries of fishing.",
        "**Fegina attracted the world**. When resort culture arrived in the early 20th century, it built on Fegina's beaches. Villas for the wealthy, hotels for visitors, eventually the Giant himself—this is Monterosso as international destination.",
        "**Both are true**. The temptation is to call old town 'authentic' and Fegina 'tourist.' But Fegina's century of resort history is authentic too—a different kind of Monterosso culture, equally valid."

The traditional salting method—specific techniques, specific timing, specific salt ratios—can only be called 'Acciughe di Monterosso' if done here by certified producers. A few families still do this work by hand, connecting today's production to centuries of practice.",
          "giuliaComment": "My grandmother processed anchovies. The smell never left her hands. She knew by touch when the cure was complete—no timer, no thermometer, just knowledge. That kind of knowledge can't be written in IGP documents. It either passes to the next generation or it dies.",

The microclimate, the soil, the traditional cultivation methods produce fruit with less acidity and more sweetness than generic lemons. The limoncello made from these fruits tastes different. The landscape they create looks different.",

The Giant was built to impress wealthy visitors. This resort culture layered onto fishing village culture, creating the duality that defines Monterosso today. Both histories are present; both are authentic.",
          "giuliaComment": "People dismiss Fegina as 'tourist.' But those early 20th century villas have their own history, their own families, their own stories. Il Gigante has watched over Fegina for over a century now. That's heritage too—just different heritage.",

        "**The Corpus Christi flower carpets**. Each year, the village creates elaborate designs on streets using thousands of flower petals, collected for months, arranged overnight, destroyed by the morning procession. The ephemeral art speaks to something deep about beauty and impermanence.",
        "**The blessing of the fleet**. Before anchovy season, boats receive blessing in the harbor. The fishermen's families attend. The priest walks the waterline. The ancient bond between village and sea becomes visible.",
        "**The August ferragosto**. The holiday brings the village together—beach competitions, evening concerts, fireworks over the water. The tourists join but locals lead. It's the closest thing to seeing old community dynamics in modern Monterosso.",
        "**The daily rhythms**. The morning fish market. The afternoon siesta. The evening passeggiata from old town through the tunnel to Fegina and back. These patterns persist despite—or perhaps because of—the tourist presence."

The landscape is sacred before it's scenic—though it's both.",

The tourism is real and dominant, but it overlays a functioning village. Locals buy fish from the same harbor tourists photograph. Children attend the same school their great-grandparents did. The village works.",
