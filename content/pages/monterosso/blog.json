The story of how it arrived here is lost, but its presence speaks to Monterosso's historical importance: even this remote coast attracted great art.",

His poetry collection 'Ossi di Seppia' (Cuttlefish Bones) distills these shores into words—the quality of light on water, the weight of Mediterranean air, the way the landscape shapes consciousness. In 1975, he received the Nobel Prize, and Monterosso claims part of that honor.",
          "giuliaComment": "Reading Montale in Monterosso is different from reading him elsewhere. The poems make sense here in ways they can't elsewhere—you see the exact light he described, feel the exact heat. The landscape becomes text, and the text becomes landscape.",
