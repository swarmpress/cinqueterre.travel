      "heading": "The Flavors That Define Monterosso",
      "content": "As the largest village in Cinque Terre, Monterosso has always been the region's culinary heart. Here, the ancient traditions of Ligurian cooking reach their most refined expression, from the legendary pesto made with sweet Genovese basil to the delicate anchovies that have sustained this coast for centuries.\n\nThe village's restaurants showcase ingredients that grow within walking distance: lemons from terraced groves, herbs from monastery gardens, olive oil pressed from trees that cling to impossible cliffsides. You'll taste trofie pasta hand-rolled each morning, paired with pesto so aromatic it seems to capture the essence of the Mediterranean scrubland itself.\n\nWhat sets Monterosso apart is its perfect balance of sophistication and authenticity. At Torre Aurora, you can dine on innovative interpretations of classic dishes while gazing out over the same coastline that inspired centuries of fishermen's tales. Meanwhile, at Il Massimo della Focaccia, the warm, olive oil-drizzled bread emerges from ovens following recipes unchanged since the Middle Ages.\n\nThe local Cinque Terre DOC wines deserve special mention. These golden whites, made from Bosco, Albarola, and Vermentino grapes grown on impossibly steep terraces, pair perfectly with the region's seafood. For a truly special experience, seek out Sciacchetrà, the rare dessert wine made from partially dried grapes – a liquid amber that captures the essence of these ancient lands."

        {
          "question": "What are the signature dishes I must try in Monterosso?",
          "answer": "Start with fresh anchovies (acciughe) prepared multiple ways – marinated, fried, or in the classic pasta alle vongole. Don't miss the hand-made trofie with pesto, focaccia col formaggio (cheese focaccia), and farinata (chickpea flatbread). For dessert, try the local gelato or pair Sciacchetrà wine with cantucci cookies."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need reservations at Monterosso restaurants?",
          "answer": "Absolutely, especially from April through October and particularly for dinner. Popular spots like Ristorante Miky and Torre Aurora book weeks in advance during peak season (June-September). For lunch, casual spots like Il Massimo della Focaccia work on a first-come basis, but even these get busy."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the best time to dine for the most authentic experience?",
          "answer": "Lunch typically runs from 12:30-2:30 PM, dinner from 7:30-10 PM. For the most local experience, arrive for lunch around 1 PM when you'll find Italian families enjoying long, leisurely meals. Evening aperitivo (6-8 PM) is perfect for wine tasting and lighter bites."
        },
        {
          "question": "How much should I budget for meals in Monterosso?",
          "answer": "Expect €15-25 for casual lunch spots, €35-60 per person for dinner at mid-range restaurants, and €80-120+ at fine dining establishments like Ristorante Miky. A glass of local Cinque Terre DOC wine runs €6-12. Budget-friendly options like focacceria meals cost €8-15."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are there good vegetarian and dietary restriction options?",
          "answer": "Yes! Ligurian cuisine naturally features many vegetarian dishes: pesto pasta, farinata, focaccia varieties, and vegetable tarts. Most restaurants accommodate dietary restrictions with advance notice. For gluten-free options, several restaurants offer gluten-free pasta and pizza bases."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I buy local ingredients to take home?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. Visit local shops for authentic pesto (refrigerated versions travel well for 2-3 days), dried pasta like trofie, local olive oil, and Cinque Terre DOC wines. The weekly market (Thursday mornings) offers fresh produce, herbs, and artisanal products directly from local producers."
