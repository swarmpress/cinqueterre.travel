      "content": "Each festival in Monterosso offers countless opportunities for stunning photographs and unforgettable memories. The Lemon Festival transforms the entire village into a golden wonderland, with citrus sculptures adorning medieval streets and locals dressed in traditional costumes.\n\nReligious processions create powerful visual narratives as centuries-old statues wind through narrow alleys, carried by generations of the same families. The soft morning light during the Corpus Domini flower carpets creates ethereal scenes that belong in Renaissance paintings.\n\nFor the most authentic shots, arrive early when locals are setting up - these behind-the-scenes moments often yield the most genuine captures. The golden hour during harvest festivals in the terraced vineyards above town offers panoramic views that encompass both celebration and landscape.\n\n**Insider's tip:** Ask permission before photographing people in traditional dress - most locals are happy to pose once they see you're genuinely interested in their culture, not just collecting tourist shots."

          "question": "When is the best time to visit for festivals?",

Spring brings religious processions like Corpus Domini, summer features the famous Lemon Festival and seafood celebrations, autumn celebrates harvest season with wine and olive festivals, while winter offers intimate nativity exhibitions and New Year traditions."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are visitors welcome to participate in local festivals?",
          "answer": "Absolutely! Monterosso's festivals are community celebrations where visitors are warmly welcomed. You can taste traditional foods, watch processions, and even help with flower carpet preparations during Corpus Domini. The locals appreciate genuine interest in their traditions."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need to book accommodation far in advance during festivals?",
          "answer": "Yes, especially for major celebrations like the Lemon Festival or Saint John the Baptist feast. Book 2-3 months ahead for popular events. Consider staying in nearby villages if Monterosso is fully booked - the train connections make it easy to join the festivities."
        },
        {
          "question": "What should I wear to religious festivals and processions?",
          "answer": "Dress respectfully for religious events - covered shoulders and knees are essential. Comfortable walking shoes are important as processions involve cobblestone streets. For food festivals, casual attire is fine, but bring a light jacket as coastal evenings can be cool."
        },
        {
          "question": "How can I learn about festivals happening during my visit?",
          "answer": "Check the local Pro Loco office near the train station for current festival schedules. Many events are announced just weeks in advance, especially smaller community celebrations. Follow Monterosso's social media or ask at your accommodation for insider information."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are festivals family-friendly?",
          "answer": "Most festivals welcome families and often include activities specifically for children. The Lemon Festival and harvest celebrations are particularly family-oriented, while some religious processions may be more solemn. Food festivals offer something for every palate, including kid-friendly options."
