The beaches that draw visitors depend on summer sun; the lemon terraces that define the landscape depend on Mediterranean warmth; the storms that crash against the shore in winter remind everyone why this coast was once feared.

        "**The red cliffs absorb heat**. Monterosso's name—Mons Rubeus, red mountain—comes from the warm stone that stores summer sun and releases it slowly. Autumn evenings stay mild longer here than anywhere on the coast.",

        "**The sea moderates everything**. Summer stays cooler than inland, winter stays warmer. The Mediterranean is nature's thermostat, and Monterosso benefits from its proximity."
