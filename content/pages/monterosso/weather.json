        "Monterosso enjoys the most favorable microclimate in the Cinque Terre, protected by surrounding mountains that create a natural windbreak. The village's western exposure means longer sunshine hours, especially crucial for those magical sunset moments at Torre Aurora.",
        "The sea moderates temperatures year-round, keeping summers cooler than inland areas and winters milder than northern Italy. This stability makes Monterosso ideal for outdoor dining experiences like Ristorante Miky's beachfront terraces, which remain comfortable even during peak summer.",
        "Rain typically arrives in short, intense bursts rather than prolonged periods. November through February sees the most precipitation, but even winter days often feature brilliant sunshine between storms. The key is flexibility - always pack layers and waterproof gear regardless of season."

        {
          "question": "What's the best month to visit Monterosso for perfect weather?",
          "answer": "May and September offer the ideal combination: warm temperatures (68-75°F), minimal rain, comfortable sea temperatures, and manageable crowds. Restaurants are fully operational, hiking conditions are perfect, and you'll enjoy 12-13 hours of daylight."
        },
        {
          "question": "When is swimming season in Monterosso?",
          "answer": "Swimming is comfortable from late May through October, with peak conditions July-September when sea temperatures reach 72°F. The protected bay means calmer waters than other Cinque Terre villages, extending the swimming season."
        },
        {
          "question": "How much rain should I expect during my visit?",
          "answer": "Monterosso receives about 35 inches annually, concentrated October-February. Summer months (June-August) average only 2-3 rainy days each. When rain comes, it's typically brief but intense - perfect for ducking into restaurants like Ristorante Ciak for authentic local cuisine."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is winter worth visiting for weather-sensitive travelers?",
          "answer": "Winter offers dramatic beauty with crystal-clear air and stunning light, but requires flexibility. Temperatures rarely drop below 45°F, and sunny days are spectacular. However, many restaurants close seasonally, and hiking can be challenging during storms."
        },
        {
          "question": "What should I pack for Monterosso's changeable weather?",
          "answer": "Layer system essential: lightweight base layers, waterproof shell, comfortable walking shoes with good grip. Sun protection year-round (UV reflects off water), and always pack a light rain jacket. Summer visits need swimwear and reef-safe sunscreen."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does weather affect restaurant dining in Monterosso?",
          "answer": "Most restaurants with terraces (like Torre Aurora and Ristorante Miky) operate weather-dependently. Spring through fall, terrace dining is reliable. Winter months see reduced hours and terrace closures, but create intimate indoor atmosphere with authentic local clientele."
