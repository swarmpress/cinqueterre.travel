From our harbor, medieval merchants carried local wine and olive oil to distant ports, while fishing families developed the techniques that still define Ligurian cuisine today.\n\nAs your boat glides past the 16th-century Aurora Tower, now home to one of Monterosso's most romantic restaurants, you'll see how each village was strategically positioned for both defense and trade. The dramatic coastline that challenges modern visitors once provided natural fortification against Saracen raiders.\n\nThe monastery bells that guided ancient mariners safely to shore still ring today, and the traditional fishing boats bobbing alongside modern tour vessels remind you that this is not just a scenic journey—it's a voyage through living history where the past and present merge as seamlessly as the horizon meets the Mediterranean."

          "question": "What boat tour options are available from Monterosso?",

Tours run from March through October, with peak season offering the most frequent departures."
        },
        {
          "question": "How far in advance should I book?",
          "answer": "For peak season (June-August), book 3-5 days ahead for group tours, 1-2 weeks for private charters. Sunset tours are especially popular and fill quickly. Spring and fall offer more flexibility, with same-day bookings often possible."

        {
          "question": "Where exactly do boats depart from in Monterosso?",
          "answer": "All tours depart from Monterosso's main harbor near the train station (Fegina beach area). Look for the boat ticket offices along Via Fegina. Departure points are clearly marked, and operators provide specific meeting instructions when booking."

          "question": "What's included and what should I bring?",
          "answer": "Most tours include life jackets and basic safety equipment. Bring sunscreen, hat, water, and comfortable clothing. Sunset tours often include aperitivo and snacks. Swimming tours provide time for ocean dips, so bring swimwear and towels."

          "question": "Can I visit other villages during the boat tour?",
          "answer": "Standard coastal tours pass all five villages for viewing and photos but don't typically include village stops. Full-day excursions may include 30-60 minute stops in Vernazza or other villages. Private charters can be customized for specific village visits."

        {
          "question": "What if weather conditions are poor?",
          "answer": "Tours operate in most conditions, but rough seas may lead to cancellations for safety. Operators typically offer full refunds or rescheduling for weather-related cancellations. Check conditions the morning of your tour, especially during spring and fall months."
