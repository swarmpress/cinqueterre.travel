        "**The village has rhythms**. Morning belongs to locals—shopping, coffee, the quiet business of daily life. Midday brings tourists flooding from trains. Evening, as the crowds thin, the village breathes again. Understanding these rhythms means knowing when to do what.",
        "**Everyone knows everyone**. In a village of 300 permanent residents, anonymity doesn't exist. The shopkeeper knows who's visiting whom. The restaurant owner knows who stayed last year. Your behavior here has memory.",
        "**Respect is earned, not assumed**. Locals have seen millions of tourists. Most blur together. The ones who return, who learn names, who say buongiorno properly—those are the ones remembered. Attention earns attention.",
        "**The real village is vertical**. The postcard shows the harbor. The village lives above—in the narrow streets climbing the hill, where laundry hangs and gardens grow and the tourists rarely wander."

No watering during dry spells. Visitors who leave taps running or take 20-minute showers reveal themselves as outsiders who don't understand the place.",
          "giuliaComment": "My grandmother could tell stories of dry summers when water was rationed. We don't face that now, but the habits remain. Water respect is built into how we live. When visitors waste water, they waste something we learned to value across generations.",

But it also brought crowds, raised prices, made the village unaffordable for many who grew up here. The locals benefit and resent in equal measure.",
