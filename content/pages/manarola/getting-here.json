      "content": [
        "**The train is the default**. Most visitors arrive through the tunnel that connects all five villages. The regional line runs frequently—every 20-30 minutes during the day. The journey from La Spezia takes 8 minutes. From Genoa, about 90 minutes. The station sits carved into the cliff, and walking out of that dark tunnel into the Ligurian light is the arrival moment.",
        "**Cars stay outside**. Parking exists, but it's limited, expensive, and far from the village center. If you must drive, accept that the car stays in the lot while you walk down. This isn't a village designed for automobiles.",
        "**Ferries offer drama**. From April to October, boats connect the villages by sea. Arriving by water means seeing Manarola as sailors have for centuries—the colored houses stacked against the cliff, the tiny harbor, the scale of human ambition against the Mediterranean.",
        "**Hiking provides context**. Walking in from Riomaggiore or Corniglia means arriving with understanding—of the terraces, the trails, the physical relationship between villages. The journey takes longer but teaches more."

The journey from Monterosso takes about 45 minutes with stops. From Portovenere, about an hour. Weather can cancel service—check morning conditions.",
          "giuliaComment": "The ferry is the arrival I recommend for first-time visitors—if the weather cooperates.
