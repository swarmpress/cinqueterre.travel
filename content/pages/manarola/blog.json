No one knows who will continue when he cannot.",

Every stone was placed by hand, without mortar, in a technique called dry-stone walling. The story goes that families would work a section for generations, never finishing, always passing the labor to the next generation. The terraces aren't a project—they're a permanent responsibility.",

The isolation that had preserved the village was ending.",

The disaster revealed how fragile the preserved landscape really was—how centuries of work could be undone in hours. The rebuilding is still ongoing.",
