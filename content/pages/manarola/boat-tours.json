      "content": [
        "**The harbor is tiny**. Manarola's marina barely qualifies—a small concrete boat ramp, a few moorings, and the waves that crash against the breakwater when the weather turns. This intimacy limits boat size but preserves authenticity.",
        "**Conditions determine everything**. The Mediterranean looks calm until it isn't. Tours run April through October when weather cooperates. Even then, rough seas can cancel departures. Flexibility is required; refunds are standard.",
        "**The coastline reveals itself**. From land, you see the villages. From sea, you see what connects them—the cliffs, the caves, the swimming coves inaccessible by foot. The perspective shift is worth the price.",
        "**Photography transforms**. The famous Manarola photograph—houses stacked against the cliff—comes from land. But the view from the water, looking back at where you stood, offers something equally powerful."
