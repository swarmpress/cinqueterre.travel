      "content": [
        "**The Romans started this**. They recognized what the steep southern exposure and Mediterranean breeze could do for grapes. They carved the first terraces, built the first stone walls without mortar, planted the first vines. The wine village identity predates everything else.",
        "**Three hundred people live here**. In a village you can cross in five minutes, that number feels correct. Everyone knows everyone. The baker knows your grandmother's maiden name. The priest knows whose boat had a good catch. Anonymity is impossible.",
        "**The compactness creates intimacy**. Riomaggiore and Vernazza feel like small towns. Corniglia feels isolated. Monterosso feels like a resort. Manarola feels like a family gathering you weren't sure you were invited to—but they set a place for you anyway.",
        "**The sunset reputation is earned**. The village faces west-northwest. The harbor creates a natural amphitheater. The pastel facades catch light in ways photography cannot quite capture. Whatever you've heard about Manarola sunsets—it's undersold."

          "giuliaComment": "The swimming rocks get crowded by noon in summer. But at 7am, you'll share them with one old man who swims every morning, winter included. He's been doing it for sixty years. He doesn't talk much, but if you show up consistently, he'll nod at you.",

It's more crowded than Corniglia. It's smaller than Vernazza. But its combination of wine culture, photogenic beauty, and perfect sunset views is unmatched.",
