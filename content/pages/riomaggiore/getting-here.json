        "The **car** is an exercise in letting go. You can drive to Cinque Terre, but you cannot drive into Riomaggiore. The village's car-free existence is not a policy; it's geography. The streets were built for donkeys, not automobiles.",
        "**Walking** remains an option—the hiking trails that connect the five villages were paths before they were attractions. To arrive on foot is to arrive as people did for centuries."
