        "The village's name means **'major river'**—a reference to the stream that once flowed openly through the center before being channeled underground. That stream shaped everything: the valley it carved became the main street, its water sustained the terraces above.",
        "**The colors are not decoration**. The pastel facades—pink, ochre, terracotta—began as a practical solution: fishermen needed to identify their homes from the sea. What tourism photographs as picturesque was survival made visible.",
        "Riomaggiore is **vertically organized**. The harbor handles the sea, the main street handles commerce, the upper terraces handle agriculture. Between them, a maze of stairs and alleys connects everything without need for horizontal streets.",
        "The **1,800 residents** who remain are mostly descendants of the original fishing families. Their dialect carries Greek influences. Their traditions predate Italian unification. Their patience with tourists is considerable but not infinite."
