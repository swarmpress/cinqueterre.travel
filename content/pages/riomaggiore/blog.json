The coastline here was deadly—rocks hidden beneath waves, currents that pulled boats to their destruction. But legend says dolphins guided their small vessels through safe passages to this sheltered inlet, where they would build the village that became Riomaggiore.",

Its position allowed watchers to see Saracen pirates approaching from any direction. When the warning bells rang, the entire village could flee inside its walls. This wasn't architecture—it was survival made stone.",
