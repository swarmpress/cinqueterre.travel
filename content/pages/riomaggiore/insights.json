        "**The streets are riverbeds**. Via Colombo follows the path of the 'Rio Major'—the major river that gave the village its name, now channeled underground. The narrow streets weren't designed; they were carved by water, then adopted by humans.",
        "**The stairs are equalizers**. In a village where everyone climbs the same stairs, class differences flatten. The wealthiest family still walks up like everyone else. Geography enforces a kind of democracy.",
        "**The dialect preserves history**. Local speech carries Greek words from eighth-century refugees, Latin from medieval administration, French from Napoleonic occupation. The way old fishermen talk is a linguistic archaeology of the village."

Traces remain in local dialect, in festival customs, in the way older families approach the sea.",

The tower houses (case-torri) were defensible family units—thick walls, small windows, multiple stories that could be sealed floor by floor. The circular castle deflected cannon fire. The narrow streets slowed invaders. This wasn't paranoia; it was response to regular Saracen raids that took people as slaves.",
          "giuliaComment": "Tourists see 'quaint narrow streets.' I see chokepoints where villagers could defend against pirates. The difference is knowing the history. Every architectural feature that looks decorative was probably defensive first.",

But the economics worked: Mediterranean sun on south-facing slopes ripened grapes that couldn't grow in the valleys. Sciacchetrà wine commanded premium prices. The terrace investment paid returns for centuries—until labor costs and tourism changed the equation.",

        "**The wine harvest** (vendemmia) is both practical and ritual. Families still work the terraces together, though some now hire help. The first pressing, the blessing of new wine, the shared meal after—these mark the agricultural year as they have for centuries.",
        "**The blessing of the boats** before the fishing season opens asks divine protection for work that remains genuinely dangerous. The harbor fills with decorated boats, the priest walks the waterline, and for a moment, the ancient relationship between village and sea becomes visible.",
        "**The mourning customs** surrounding death preserve medieval practices: certain clothes, certain foods, certain visitors in certain order. When someone dies in Riomaggiore, the old ways reassert themselves even in families that have otherwise modernized."

This isn't laziness—it's rhythm. The village has always worked early and late, resting in the middle. Fighting this rhythm exhausts you; following it reveals how the place actually functions.",
