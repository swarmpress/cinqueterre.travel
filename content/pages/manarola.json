          "question": "What makes Manarola different from the other Cinque Terre villages?",
          "answer": "Manarola is the oldest wine-producing village, with Roman terraces still in use today. It's the starting point of Via dell'Amore and features the most dramatic clifftop dining experiences. The village is also notably compact, making it perfect for intimate exploration."
        },
        {
          "question": "When is the best time to experience Manarola's wine culture?",
          "answer": "September through October during harvest season offers the most authentic experience. You can witness grape picking, participate in traditional wine-making activities, and taste the freshest Sciacchetrà. Spring (April-May) is also excellent with fewer crowds and beautiful weather for vineyard walks."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I make reservations at the clifftop restaurants?",
          "answer": "Book well in advance, especially for sunset tables. Il Porticciolo requires reservations for harbor-view tables, La Scogliera books up quickly for sunset seatings, and Terrazza del Borgo is essential to reserve for panoramic terrace tables. Call directly or book online 2-4 weeks ahead during peak season."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I visit the vineyards and taste Sciacchetrà wine?",
          "answer": "Yes, several local producers offer tastings by appointment. The Cooperativa Agricola Cinque Terre provides organized tours that include vineyard visits and Sciacchetrà tastings. Book through your concierge or contact them directly for authentic experiences with local wine masters."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the best way to photograph Manarola's famous harbor scene?",
          "answer": "The classic shot is from the rocks on the harbor's south side, best during golden hour (30 minutes before sunset). For the most dramatic lighting, visit during late afternoon when the houses are illuminated against darker cliffs. Professional photographers recommend the elevated viewpoint near the church for wider compositions."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long should I spend in Manarola?",
          "answer": "A minimum of half a day allows you to explore the village, visit the church, and enjoy a meal with views. For the full experience including vineyard visits, wine tastings, and sunset dining, plan a full day or consider staying overnight to experience the village after day-trippers leave."
