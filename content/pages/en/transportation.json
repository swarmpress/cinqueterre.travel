          "question": "How often do trains run?",
          "answer": "Every 15-20 minutes in peak season. Slightly less frequent in winter. Trains are small and can be crowded - try off-peak hours."
        },
        {
          "question": "Where should I park my car?",
          "answer": "Best option: La Spezia Centrale parking garage (€15-20/day). From there, trains reach villages in 10-20 minutes. Monterosso and Riomaggiore have limited parking (€25-30/day)."

          "question": "Are ferries worth it?",
          "answer": "For the experience - absolutely! Views are spectacular. But they're slower, weather-dependent, and not included in the Cinque Terre Card. Perfect for one leg of a day trip."

        {
          "question": "Can I take luggage on trains?",
          "answer": "Yes, but trains are small and crowded. Pack light! Some travelers leave bags in La Spezia luggage storage for day trips."

        {
          "question": "What if I'm staying in one village?",
          "answer": "You can walk between villages on the trails. But the train is faster for hopping around. The Card pays off quickly with multiple trips."
