This amber elixir, produced in quantities so small that most of the world never tastes it, represents the pinnacle of Cinque Terre winemaking.\n\nThe process begins in September when perfect grape clusters are hand-selected and laid on reed mats to dry slowly in ventilated rooms. Over three months, they transform into raisins, concentrating their sugars and developing complex flavors. The resulting wine, aged in small barrels, offers notes of honey, dried fruits, and herbs - a liquid embodiment of these sun-soaked terraces.\n\nMany agriturismi offer exclusive Sciacchetrà tastings paired with local cheeses and chestnuts, sometimes in the same cellars where the wine ages. These intimate experiences, often limited to just a few guests, provide access to vintages that never reach commercial markets."

          "question": "What makes Corniglia's agriturismi different from other Cinque Terre accommodations?",
          "answer": "Corniglia's agriturismi offer authentic agricultural experiences impossible elsewhere. You'll stay within working vineyards and farms, participate in traditional activities like winemaking and olive harvesting, and learn from families who've worked these terraces for generations. The village's inland location means fewer tourists and more genuine cultural immersion."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need to climb the famous 377 steps to reach the agriturismi?",
          "answer": "Not necessarily. While the iconic Lardarina stairway connects the train station to the village, many agriturismi offer pickup services or are accessible by the shuttle bus that runs from the station. Some properties are located along the hillside paths with easier access routes."
        },
        {
          "question": "What agricultural activities can I participate in during my stay?",
          "answer": "Activities vary by season but may include grape harvesting, wine pressing, olive picking, terracing maintenance, pruning vines, tending kitchen gardens, and learning traditional preservation techniques. Most agriturismi also offer cooking classes using farm-grown ingredients and private wine tastings featuring their own productions."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are meals included at Corniglia agriturismi?",
          "answer": "Most luxury agriturismi offer half-board or full-board options featuring farm-to-table cuisine. Expect meals made with ingredients grown on the property - fresh vegetables, herbs, olive oil, wine, and sometimes cheese or preserved meats. Many properties can accommodate dietary restrictions with advance notice."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I purchase wine and products directly from the agriturismi?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. This is one of the greatest advantages of staying at working farms. Most agriturismi sell their own wine, olive oil, honey, preserves, and other artisan products directly to guests. You'll often find exclusive vintages or limited productions not available in shops, including the rare Sciacchetrà dessert wine."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the best time to visit for the most authentic agricultural experience?",
          "answer": "September through November offers the most active agricultural period with grape and olive harvests. Spring (April-May) is ideal for learning about vine cultivation and terracing maintenance. Each season provides different experiences - winter for olive pressing and wine aging, summer for vegetable gardening and grape tending."
