          "answer": "You have three options: climb the famous 377-step Lardarina stairway (15-20 minutes), take the shuttle bus that runs every 30 minutes during peak season (€1.50), or follow the longer but gentler road path. The stairway offers the most dramatic approach with stunning coastal views at each landing."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the best way to navigate between restaurants?",
          "answer": "Corniglia's compact size makes everything walkable within 5 minutes. Via Fieschi is the main street connecting all major restaurants. Cecio is slightly off the main path on Via Serra, while Osteria Mananan and Cantina de Mananan are both on Via Fieschi. The village has clear signage in Italian and English."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which hiking trails start from Corniglia?",
          "answer": "Three main trails depart from Corniglia: the scenic coastal path to Vernazza (1.5 hours, moderate difficulty), the vineyard route to Manarola (1 hour, easy-moderate), and the challenging climb to Volastra (45 minutes, steep). All trailheads are clearly marked from the village center."
        },
        {
          "question": "Where are the best viewpoints for photography?",
          "answer": "The panoramic terrace behind San Pietro Church offers 270-degree coastal views. The Lardarina stairway landings provide dramatic cliff perspectives. For sunset shots, head to the western edge near Via Fieschi 117. The vineyard terraces above the village offer elevated views of the coastline."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I find the wine tasting locations?",
          "answer": "Cantina de Mananan is the main wine cellar, located at Via Fieschi 115 in a historic stone building. Look for the wooden wine barrel sign. Several family-run wine shops along Via Fieschi offer tastings of local Cinque Terre DOC wines. Osteria Mananan also features extensive wine selections with sommelier guidance."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is Corniglia accessible for people with mobility challenges?",
          "answer": "Corniglia presents the most challenges among Cinque Terre villages due to its clifftop location. The shuttle bus provides easier access than the stairway, but the village itself has narrow, uneven stone streets. The main street (Via Fieschi) is relatively flat, but restaurants may have steps and terraces aren't wheelchair accessible."
