      "content": "Choosing an apartment in Corniglia means embracing the village's unique position as the agricultural heart of the Cinque Terre. Unlike its coastal neighbors, this clifftop settlement developed around wine production rather than fishing, creating a distinctly different atmosphere that feels remarkably authentic.\n\nYour days begin with sunrise over the Apennine Mountains, filtered through ancient vineyard terraces that have remained virtually unchanged since Roman times. The village center, a five-minute walk from most apartments, centers around Via Fieschi - a charming pedestrian street lined with family-run shops, intimate restaurants like the beloved Cecio, and the atmospheric Cantina de Mananan for evening wine tastings.\n\nThe absence of a harbor means Corniglia maintains its peaceful character even during peak summer months. You'll find yourself shopping for fresh focaccia at the local bakery alongside residents whose families have lived here for generations, learning about terraced agriculture from elderly vintners who still tend their plots by hand, and discovering hidden viewpoints known only to locals.\n\nMost Corniglia apartments feature traditional elements like exposed stone walls, terra cotta floors, and wooden beam ceilings, combined with modern kitchens perfect for preparing meals with ingredients from the weekly market. Private terraces are common, often carved into the hillside with stunning views over the Mediterranean or back toward the vineyard-covered mountains.",

          "question": "How do I reach my apartment from Corniglia train station?",
          "answer": "You have two options: climb the famous 377-step Lardarina stairway (about 10-15 minutes) or take the shuttle bus that runs every 20 minutes during daylight hours. Most apartment hosts provide detailed directions and can arrange luggage assistance if needed."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are Corniglia apartments suitable for families with young children?",
          "answer": "Yes, but choose carefully. The village's elevated position and terraced layout include steep drops and stairs. Look for ground-floor apartments or those with secure terraces. The peaceful atmosphere and open spaces make it ideal for older children who can appreciate the natural beauty."
        },
        {
          "question": "What dining options are within walking distance?",
          "answer": "Corniglia offers excellent restaurants within the compact village center. Cecio serves authentic family recipes, Osteria Mananan provides fine dining with sea views, and Cantina de Mananan specializes in local wine tastings. Several cafés and a small grocery store complete the options."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I access other Cinque Terre villages easily from Corniglia?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. The train station connects to all villages in 5-20 minutes, and hiking trails lead to both Vernazza and Manarola. Many guests find Corniglia the perfect base for exploring while returning to a peaceful retreat each evening."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need a car to stay in Corniglia?",
          "answer": "No car needed or recommended. The village is pedestrian-only with very limited parking outside the center. Public transport, walking, and cycling are the best ways to explore. Some apartments include bicycle access for exploring local vineyard paths."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the best time to book a Corniglia apartment?",
          "answer": "Book 3-6 months ahead for peak season (June-September). Spring and fall offer excellent weather with fewer crowds. Winter stays provide a unique perspective on local life, though some restaurants may have reduced hours."
