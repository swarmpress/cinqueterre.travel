        "**About the stairs**: Yes, 377 steps. Yes, you must climb them. No, there's no easy alternative. The shuttle bus is unreliable. The climb is part of choosing Corniglia.",
        "**About the beaches**: No direct beach access. Swimming requires descent to remote coves or trains to other villages. Corniglia chose terraces over harbor.",
        "**About the food**: Fewer restaurants than coastal villages, but concentrated quality. Cecio, Osteria Mananan, Cantina de Mananan—each excellent. Reservations matter.",
        "**About the experience**: Quieter, more agricultural, less overtly touristic. For visitors who want wine terraces over beach bars, evening peace over harbor bustle, authenticity over convenience."

          "description": "A small shuttle bus operates April-October, but it runs irregularly, fills quickly, and can't be counted on. Luggage services exist (€10-15 per bag). If mobility issues make stairs impossible, Corniglia may not be accessible to you—this is a genuine limitation of the village's geography.",
          "giuliaComment": "I understand why people ask. But the stairs exist because the village is where it is, and the village is where it is because our ancestors wanted terraces, not a harbor. The stairs aren't a flaw—they're the consequence of a choice that created everything we love about this place.",

But if you want to see what Cinque Terre was before tourism—wine terraces, quiet streets, agricultural rhythms—Corniglia offers that in concentrated form. An hour here reveals something the coastal villages have lost.",
          "giuliaComment": "I tell day visitors: don't come to Corniglia just to say you visited five villages. Come if our character matches what you're seeking. Some people spend an hour here and understand something. Others check a box and leave confused. Know why you're climbing.",

          "description": "Cecio is where locals eat—four generations of family recipes, garden-fresh ingredients, the cooking your Ligurian grandmother would make if you had one. Osteria Mananan offers more refined preparations with spectacular views. The Cantina below it is for wine lovers who want tastings and small plates. All require reservations for dinner.",
          "giuliaComment": "I eat at Cecio weekly. It's not fancy—it's just right. The Mananan properties are for visitors wanting more polish, and they do it excellently. Don't expect the choice paralysis of bigger villages—we have a few places doing things well rather than many places doing things adequately.",

        "**What should I bring?** Good shoes for stairs and trails. Layers for variable temperatures. Light luggage if staying—every bag climbs with you.",
        "**Can I drive?** Technically roads exist, but parking is nearly impossible and the village is pedestrian. Take the train like everyone else."

          "description": "The other four villages are coastal in identity: harbors, fishing history, waterfront dining. Corniglia turned inward, upward, into the terraces. The result is quieter streets, deeper wine culture, less tourist infrastructure, and a different relationship with the landscape. For some visitors, this is exactly right. For others, it feels like something's missing.",
          "giuliaComment": "We're not better or worse than our neighbors—we're different. They chose the sea; we chose the terraces. They host more visitors; we host fewer but differently. The question isn't which village is best—it's which matches what you're looking for.",

          "description": "The evening is when Corniglia becomes itself. The day trippers descend the stairs; the village takes a breath; locals emerge from heat-avoidance; the aperitivo hour begins. Staying overnight means experiencing this transformation—the quiet dinner, the morning climb when you have the stairs to yourself, the rhythm of a place that exists beyond visitor hours.",
          "giuliaComment": "Everyone should stay at least one night. Not because day visits are worthless—they're not—but because the evening village is something you can't photograph, can't rush through, can't experience in a few hours. It's what Corniglia actually is. Day visitors see the postcard; overnight guests see the life.",
