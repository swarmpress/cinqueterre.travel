        "**The name carries ancient history**. Corniglia may derive from the Roman Gens Cornelia, suggesting settlement when Latin was still spoken. Unlike the medieval origins of other villages, this one reaches back further—into the time when these slopes first seemed worth cultivating.",
        "**The land tells its own stories**. Walk the terraces above the village and you see layers of labor—walls built in different centuries, repair work from different disasters, the ongoing effort that has kept this landscape productive for a millennium.",
        "**The isolation shaped character**. Without a harbor, Corniglia never had the maritime culture of its neighbors. No fishermen's tales here. The stories are of farmers, of vintners, of people who looked up at their vineyards rather than out at the sea.",
        "**The stairs created privacy**. The 382 steps that now deter tourists once protected the village from casual intrusion. The stories that developed here stayed here, shared among families who had lived close together for generations."

The terraces may have begun under their supervision, the agricultural tradition they brought lasting longer than their empire.",

The labor was immense, the motivation simple: the wine from these slopes was worth the effort. The terraces are monuments to that calculus, to generations who bet their bodies on the harvest.",

The pressing happens in winter. The aging takes years. The process cannot be hurried. Corniglia families guard their methods—the exact drying time, the particular pressing technique, the barrels that have been used for generations.",
