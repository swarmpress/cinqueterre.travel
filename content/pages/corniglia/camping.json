      "title": "Camping Options Near Corniglia",
      "content": "While Corniglia itself doesn't have camping facilities within the village boundaries—a blessing that preserves its medieval character—several excellent options exist within a short distance. **Camping Acquadolce** in nearby Monterosso offers luxury glamping pods with sea views, just a 15-minute train ride away. For a more rustic experience, **Camping Il Pozzo** near Levanto provides traditional tent sites surrounded by olive groves.\n\n**Insider tip from Lorenzo:** The most authentic experience comes from **Agriturismo La Sosta** in the hills above Corniglia. This family-run farm offers camping spaces among their vineyards, where you'll wake to the sound of church bells echoing through the valleys—exactly as local farmers have for centuries.\n\n**Practical considerations:** Book well in advance for April through October. Many sites require minimum 3-night stays during peak season. Consider the daily trek up Corniglia's famous 377-step Lardarina stairway when packing—lightweight gear becomes essential."

      "title": "Living the Medieval Village Experience",
      "content": "Corniglia's unique position as the only Cinque Terre village not directly on the sea creates an entirely different rhythm for camping visitors. Unlike the maritime bustle of the coastal villages, here you'll experience the ancient agricultural heartbeat that has sustained this community since Roman times.\n\n**Dawn rituals:** Local farmers still tend their terraced vineyards at sunrise—join them for an authentic glimpse into centuries-old traditions. The village's **Via Fieschi** comes alive with the aroma of fresh focaccia from local bakeries, perfect for stocking up before day hikes.\n\n**Evening magic:** As daytrippers depart, Corniglia transforms into an intimate mountain village. Secure a sunset table at **Osteria Mananan's** panoramic terrace—the golden hour views over terraced vineyards stretching to the Mediterranean create memories that define your entire Cinque Terre experience.\n\n**Cultural immersion:** Time your visit with local festivals celebrating the harvest season, when ancient songs echo through stone streets and three-generation families share traditional recipes that predate tourism by centuries."
