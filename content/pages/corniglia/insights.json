      "title": "The Soul of Agricultural Cinque Terre",
      "content": "Walking through Corniglia is like stepping into a living museum of Mediterranean agriculture. Unlike its coastal neighbors, this village developed purely as a farming community, and that heritage permeates every aspect of daily life.\n\nThe morning ritual begins before dawn, as local families tend to their terraced vineyards using tools and techniques that would be familiar to their Roman ancestors. The dry stone walls, or \"muri a secco,\" that support these terraces represent over 2,000 years of engineering wisdom, built without mortar yet standing strong against winter storms and summer heat.\n\nThe village's elevated position—100 meters above the Mediterranean—created unique cultural characteristics. Here, the rhythm of life follows agricultural seasons rather than fishing tides. September's grape harvest transforms the village into a celebration, with families gathering to press grapes using wooden presses passed down through generations.\n\nAt Cecio, the village's beloved family trattoria, recipes haven't changed in decades. Their trofie al pesto uses basil from the family's own terraced garden, while the house wine comes from vines visible from the dining room windows. This is dining as cultural immersion—every meal tells the story of the land."

        {
          "question": "What makes Corniglia culturally different from other Cinque Terre villages?",
          "answer": "Corniglia developed as a purely agricultural community rather than a fishing village, creating unique traditions centered around wine-making and farming. Its elevated position isolated it from maritime influences, preserving ancient Roman agricultural practices that continue today."
        },
        {
          "question": "When is the best time to experience local traditions?",
          "answer": "September during harvest season offers the most authentic cultural experiences. However, spring (April-May) shows the terraces in bloom, while early October features wine-pressing celebrations. Avoid July-August when tourist crowds can overshadow local culture."
        },
        {
          "question": "How can visitors respectfully engage with local culture?",
          "answer": "Book wine tastings with local families, dine at traditional restaurants like Cecio, and visit during working hours to see terraces being maintained. Always stay on marked paths—the terraces are working farmland, not tourist attractions."
        },
        {
          "question": "What traditional foods should I try in Corniglia?",
          "answer": "Essential experiences include trofie al pesto made with local basil, fresh farinata (chickpea pancake), anchovies prepared Corniglia-style, and most importantly, Sciacchetrà dessert wine—a rare specialty made from dried grapes that represents centuries of local winemaking tradition."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do local families preserve ancient traditions?",
          "answer": "Knowledge passes through families via hands-on learning. Children learn terrace maintenance, traditional pruning techniques, and wine-making from grandparents. The village's isolation helped preserve these practices when other areas modernized."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can visitors participate in agricultural activities?",
          "answer": "Some local families offer harvest experiences during September grape-picking season. Contact the village tourist office or ask at restaurants like Cecio about connecting with families who welcome visitors. These experiences must be arranged in advance and require respectful participation in working agriculture."
