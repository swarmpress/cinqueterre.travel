            "title": "Pesto Genovese: The Real Thing",
            "text": "Forget the jarred versions. True pesto uses Genovese basil (smaller, more aromatic leaves), pine nuts from Pisa, Parmigiano and Pecorino in specific ratios, and Ligurian olive oil. It's traditionally made with a marble mortar and wooden pestle - the 'pestare' (pounding) gives the sauce its name. Serve it with trofie (hand-rolled pasta twists) or trenette, never spaghetti. Add a splash of pasta water to emulsify, and never heat the pesto - toss it with hot pasta off the flame."

            "title": "Anchovies: The Cinque Terre Staple",
            "text": "Fresh anchovies (acciughe) aren't the salty fillets from a tin. In Cinque Terre, they're served marinated in lemon (acciughe marinate), fried crispy (friscieu), or baked with potatoes. The anchovy catch shaped local cuisine for centuries. Look for 'acciughe di Monterosso' - the local variety is prized for its delicate flavor. Salt-packed anchovies from Liguria are exported worldwide, but the fresh preparations are what locals prefer."

          {
            "title": "Focaccia and Farinata",
            "text": "Ligurian focaccia is thin, oily, and topped simply with coarse salt and sometimes rosemary or onions. It's breakfast, snack, and aperitivo food. Farinata is even more local - a thin chickpea flour pancake cooked in wood-fired copper pans. Crispy edges, soft center, eaten hot with pepper. The best bakeries open early and sell out by noon. In Vernazza, Forno Moltedo has served focaccia since 1963."

            "text": "Start with focaccia di Recco (paper-thin with stracchino cheese) or muscoli ripieni (stuffed mussels). For primo, trofie al pesto or pansoti (ravioli with walnut sauce). For secondo, fresh catch of the day (pesce del giorno) simply grilled, or stoccafisso accomodato (stockfish stew). Finish with canestrelli cookies and a glass of Sciacchetra dessert wine. Skip the tiramisu - it's not Ligurian."
