            "text": "The famous staircase of 382 steps (or take the shuttle bus) is your initiation into Corniglia. It's steep and can be hot, but it serves a purpose: it keeps the crowds away. By the time you reach the top, you've earned your arrival. The views from the top are spectacular."

            "text": "Via Fieschi, the main pedestrian street, is where locals actually live. Unlike the tourist-focused main drags of other villages, here you'll find residents chatting on benches, laundry hanging between buildings, and shops that cater to locals first. The pace is noticeably slower."

            "text": "The terrace behind the Church of San Pietro offers the best views and is usually empty. Alberto Gelateria makes gelato with honey from local bees. The small wine bar at the end of Via Fieschi serves glasses of local wine for half what you'd pay in Vernazza. The path toward Guvano beach starts here—an adventure for another day."
