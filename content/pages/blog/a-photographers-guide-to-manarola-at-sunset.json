            "title": "The Classic Viewpoint",
            "text": "The famous shot is taken from the cemetery pathway and rocks below it, just past the church on the south side of the village. Arrive at least 90 minutes before sunset to claim your spot—serious photographers set up tripods early. The best positions are on the flat rocks near the water."

            "title": "Timing Is Everything",
            "text": "Check sunset times for your specific date. The magic happens in the 30 minutes before and after sunset. As the sun dips, the houses glow orange, then pink, then the village lights flicker on. Blue hour (20-40 minutes after sunset) creates the most dramatic images with the lights reflected in the sea."

            "title": "Camera Settings",
            "text": "For sunset: ISO 100-400, aperture f/8-f/11 for sharpness, shutter speed varies with light. For blue hour: ISO 400-800, aperture f/8, shutter 1-8 seconds (tripod essential). Shoot RAW for maximum editing flexibility. A polarizing filter can reduce glare on the water."

            "text": "For something different, try the viewing platform near Nessun Dorma—it's higher and shows more of the terraced hillsides. Or descend to the harbor and shoot upward toward the village. In the morning, the view from the trail toward Corniglia catches beautiful soft light on the village."
