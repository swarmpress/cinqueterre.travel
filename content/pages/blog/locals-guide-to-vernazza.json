        "intro": "Vernazza is the most photographed village in Cinque Terre, its natural harbor and medieval tower appearing on every Italian travel poster. But the village beyond the viewpoints - the Vernazza where 850 residents live, work, and gather - offers something richer than any postcard.",

            "title": "The Real Piazza Marconi",
            "text": "Yes, the harbor piazza is packed by 10am. But arrive at 7am and you'll see fishermen sorting catches, nonnas gossiping on benches, and the only sound is coffee cups clinking at Bar Baia Saracena. This is when locals own their piazza. Evening after 8pm brings a similar transformation - tourists retreat to their accommodations, and the piazza becomes a living room where everyone knows everyone."

            "title": "The Upper Village",
            "text": "Most visitors never climb above the main street. But Vernazza rises steeply, and the upper neighborhoods (reached via Via Roma's staircases) reveal the working village. Small gardens tucked between houses. Laundry strung between windows. Old men playing cards in doorways. The views from the Santuario di Nostra Signora di Reggio (a 25-minute climb) are spectacular, and you'll likely have them to yourself."

          {
            "title": "Where Locals Actually Eat",
            "text": "Skip the waterfront restaurants charging view premiums. Locals eat at Trattoria Il Porticciolo (book ahead, cash only) for simple seafood. Gambero Rosso has the best pesto. For takeaway focaccia, Forno Moltedo opens at 7am and sells out by noon. On hot days, locals grab a cone at Gelateria Vernazza then sit on the breakwater rocks - no table charge, better views."

            "title": "The Secret Swimming Spot",
            "text": "The main beach gets crowded. Walk past the church toward Monterosso on the coastal path for 5 minutes and you'll find flat rocks where locals swim. The water is cleaner away from the harbor, and you can spot octopi in the clear shallows. Bring a mask - the underwater rocks are covered in sea life."

            "title": "Evening Ritual",
            "text": "The Vernazza passeggiata (evening stroll) happens around 6-8pm. Start with an aperitivo at Ananasso Bar (try the local white wine with olives). Walk the main street, stop to chat. End at the breakwater to watch sunset paint the tower gold. This isn't a tourist activity - it's the daily rhythm locals have followed for generations. Join respectfully and you become part of it."
