        {
          "question": "How many days do I need for Cinque Terre?",
          "answer": "Three days minimum allows you to visit all five villages with time for hiking and relaxation. Two days feels rushed but covers the highlights. Five days lets you explore deeply, including nearby Portovenere and Levanto. Most visitors find 3-4 days ideal for experiencing the region without feeling hurried."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I drive between the villages?",
          "answer": "Cars are prohibited or severely restricted in all five villages. Monterosso has limited paid parking (EUR2/hour, EUR25/day) but fills quickly. The most practical approach is parking in La Spezia (EUR15-20/day) or Levanto (EUR18-25/day) and using trains exclusively. This eliminates stress and aligns with the region's sustainable tourism goals."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is the hiking difficult and are trails open?",
          "answer": "The famous Blue Trail (Sentiero Azzurro) varies dramatically by section. Monterosso to Vernazza is moderate (90 minutes). Vernazza to Corniglia is challenging with steep climbs (90 minutes). The Corniglia to Manarola section has been closed since 2011 due to landslides. Manarola to Riomaggiore (Via dell'Amore) reopens in 2024 after decade-long restoration. Always check current trail status at park offices."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the best village to stay in?",
          "answer": "Monterosso suits families and luxury travelers with sandy beaches and upscale hotels. Vernazza offers the most photogenic harbor and classic atmosphere but gets very crowded. Manarola provides stunning sunset views and fewer tourists. Corniglia sits high above the sea with vineyard views but requires a 377-step climb from the station. Riomaggiore has the best restaurant scene and nightlife options."
        },
        {
          "question": "How crowded does it get and when should I avoid?",
          "answer": "July and August bring overwhelming crowds, especially on weekends. Easter through October sees heavy tourist traffic during midday (10am-4pm). Early morning (before 9am) and evening (after 5pm) offer more peaceful experiences. Shoulder seasons (April-May, September-October) provide the best balance of good weather and manageable crowds. Winter offers solitude but many restaurants and services close."
        },
        {
          "question": "How much does everything cost?",
          "answer": "Daily budget breakdown: Transportation (Cinque Terre Card EUR16), meals (EUR35-60 per person for lunch and dinner), accommodation (EUR80-250 per night depending on season and village), activities like boat tours (EUR25-35). Total daily cost ranges from EUR80 for budget travelers to EUR200+ for luxury experiences. Grocery shopping and avoiding tourist-trap restaurants near train stations can significantly reduce costs."
        },
        {
          "question": "What about accessibility and mobility issues?",
          "answer": "Cinque Terre presents significant mobility challenges. All villages except Monterosso require extensive stair climbing from train stations to town centers. Corniglia demands a 377-step ascent. Wheelchairs and mobility scooters face serious limitations. Monterosso offers the most accessible experience with beach access and fewer stairs. The regional trains are accessible, but village navigation requires good mobility. Consider this carefully when planning your visit."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I visit as a day trip from Florence or Rome?",
          "answer": "From Florence: Yes, feasible but long. Departure by 7am allows 6-8 hours in Cinque Terre, returning by 10pm. High-speed train to La Spezia takes 2.5 hours each way. From Rome: Extremely challenging as a day trip. The 4+ hour journey each way leaves minimal time for exploration. Consider staying overnight in La Spezia or within Cinque Terre for a more enjoyable experience."

      "title": "Insider Tips for First-Time Visitors",
      "content": "After guiding thousands of travelers through Cinque Terre, these details make the difference between a good trip and an unforgettable one.\n\n**Train Strategy**: Board trains from the middle cars - they're less crowded and closer to village center exits. Keep your validated ticket until you fully exit the final station; inspectors check frequently.\n\n**Timing Secrets**: Visit Vernazza's harbor before 9am or after 6pm for photos without crowds. Manarola's sunset viewpoint gets busy, but the walk to Punta Bonfiglio offers equally stunning views with fewer people.\n\n**Local Etiquette**: Restaurants don't rush you once seated - linger over wine and conversation. However, many kitchens close between 2:30-7pm, so plan accordingly. Always greet shopkeepers with 'Buongiorno' or 'Buonasera.'\n\n**Weather Wisdom**: Sea breezes keep temperatures comfortable even in summer, but pack layers. Sudden afternoon storms are common April through October - carry a light rain jacket.\n\n**Photography Note**: The famous postcard shots of Manarola are taken from Via Beccara, a 5-minute walk south of the village center. Arrive 30 minutes before sunset for the best positioning."
