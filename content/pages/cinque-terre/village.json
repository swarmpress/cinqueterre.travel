This authentic glimpse into centuries of maritime tradition is best experienced before 8 AM when the village belongs to locals.\n\n**Climb to the Castle:** The 13th-century fortress offers commanding views of the coastline. Originally built as defense against Saracen raids, today it hosts exhibitions and provides perfect photography opportunities.\n\n**The Main Street:** Via Colombo serves as the spine of village life, connecting the harbor to the upper village through a colorful cascade of shops, trattorias, and family homes.\n\n**The Sanctuary Path:** A pilgrimage route through terraced vineyards leads to Montenero, where panoramic views reward those willing to climb."
