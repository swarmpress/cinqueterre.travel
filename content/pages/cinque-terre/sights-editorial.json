          "description": "The harbor of Riomaggiore is not a port in any grand sense. It is a slipway, a few boats pulled up onto the rocks, and a small piazza where the village exhales into the Mediterranean. This is where the rhythm of the day is set—fishermen preparing their nets at dawn, visitors arriving by ferry, the evening passeggiata as the sun drops.",
          "orientation": "The harbor faces southeast, catching the morning light. The classic view is from the rocks to the left of the slipway.",
          "editorComment": "Come before 8 AM if you want to see the harbor as it has always been—a working place, not a backdrop. The light is softer, the tourists are still sleeping, and the fishermen will nod at you if you're quiet enough.",

          "description": "Via Colombo is the only real street in Riomaggiore—a narrow passage that climbs from the harbor to the railway station, lined with shops, restaurants, and the everyday business of village life. It is both a thoroughfare and a living room, where locals stop to chat and laundry hangs overhead.",
          "orientation": "The street runs from the harbor (bottom) to the station (top). The morning sun illuminates the lower section.",
          "editorComment": "Don't rush through. Stop at the alimentari (grocery shops) and look at what's local. The rhythm of the street changes throughout the day—busy at lunch, sleepy at siesta, alive again for the passeggiata.",

          "description": "The parish church of Riomaggiore is a study in contrasts—a Gothic structure built from the dark stone of the hillside, softened by the light that streams through its rose window. It has witnessed every baptism, wedding, and funeral in the village for nearly seven centuries.",
          "orientation": "Located in the upper village, facing west. The rose window is best photographed in late afternoon light.",

          "description": "The castle above Riomaggiore was built to defend against Saracen pirates, a threat that once defined life on this coast. Today, its circular tower stands as a reminder of harder times, and its terrace offers one of the most commanding views of the village and the sea beyond.",
          "orientation": "The castle looks out over the harbor to the southwest. The sunset views are exceptional.",
          "editorComment": "The climb is worth it for the solitude alone. Most visitors stick to the main street, so the castle is often empty. Bring a picnic and a bottle of wine—this is where I come when I need perspective.",

          "description": "Perched 340 meters above the village, the Sanctuary of Montenero has been a place of pilgrimage since the 9th century. The climb is demanding but rewarding—each step takes you further from the crowds and closer to a view that encompasses the entire coastline.",
          "orientation": "The sanctuary faces the sea, with views stretching from Riomaggiore to Portovenere on clear days.",
          "editorComment": "This is my favorite walk in the entire Cinque Terre. Start early, bring water, and take your time. The sanctuary has a small bar where the espresso tastes better than anywhere in the village—you've earned it.",

          "orientation": "Best viewed from the hiking trails above the village or from the sanctuary path.",
