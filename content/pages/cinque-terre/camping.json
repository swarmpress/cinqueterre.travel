Each morning, wake to the scent of wild herbs and the distant sound of fishing boats preparing for their ancient ritual.\n\nInsider tip: Book sites on the eastern slopes for spectacular sunrises over the Gulf of Poets, where Lord Byron once swam in waters that still shimmer with the same golden light.\n\n**Peak Season Strategy**: April through October offers ideal weather, but September and early October provide the perfect balance of warm days, cool evenings, and fewer crowds. Many campgrounds offer 'shoulder season' packages with complimentary wine tastings and guided foraging walks."

      "content": "Camping in this region connects you to traditions that stretch back to when these villages were vital stops along medieval pilgrimage routes. Your campsite neighbors might include **contadini** (local farmers) who still tend ancient terraces by hand, using techniques passed down through generations.\n\nMany camping areas are located on former monastery grounds or near chapels where travelers have sought shelter for centuries. At **Camping La Secca** near Bonassola, you're steps from a 12th-century oratory where pilgrims once prayed before the treacherous coastal journey.\n\nThe evening **passeggiata** (leisurely stroll) takes on new meaning when you can join locals walking the same stone paths their ancestors carved. Watch for the subtle rituals: fishermen mending nets by lamplight, elderly women sharing stories on stone benches, children playing games that echo through narrow *caruggi* (medieval alleyways).\n\n**Cultural Immersion**: Time your stay with village festivals like Monterosso's Lemon Festival in May or Vernazza's Santa Margherita celebration in July, when camping guests are often welcomed into community celebrations."
