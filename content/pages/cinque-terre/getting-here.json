        "For centuries, these villages remained accessible only by sea or treacherous mountain paths. The arrival of the railway in 1874 changed everything, carving tunnels through ancient rock and creating one of the world's most spectacular train journeys.",
        "Today's travelers follow the same route that connected these fishing communities to the wider world. The **Cinque Terre Express** runs every 15-30 minutes during peak season, threading between villages like pearls on a coastal string.",
        "**From Rome**: Board a Frecciarossa high-speed train to La Spezia Centrale (4.5 hours). The journey transforms from urban landscapes to rolling Tuscan hills, finally revealing the Ligurian coast's dramatic beauty.",
        "**From Milan**: Direct trains reach La Spezia in just 3 hours via the scenic Apennine passes. Morning departures arrive perfectly timed for lunch overlooking the Mediterranean.",
        "**Insider's tip**: Purchase your **Cinque Terre Card** at La Spezia station. This includes unlimited local train travel plus hiking trail access—essential for exploring beyond the villages themselves."

        {
          "question": "What's the best airport for reaching Cinque Terre?",
          "answer": "Pisa Galilei Airport offers the most direct route—just 1.5 hours by train to La Spezia via the coastal line. Genoa (2 hours) and Milan Malpensa (3.5 hours) are excellent alternatives with more international connections."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I drive directly to the villages?",
          "answer": "Limited vehicle access protects these UNESCO sites. Monterosso al Mare offers some parking, while other villages have ZTL (traffic-limited zones). We recommend parking in La Spezia or Levanto and taking the train—it's faster and more relaxing."
        },
        {
          "question": "How often do trains run between villages?",
          "answer": "During peak season (May-September), the Cinque Terre Express runs every 15-20 minutes from 6:00 AM to midnight. Off-season service runs every 30-60 minutes. Journey time between adjacent villages is just 2-5 minutes."
        },
        {
          "question": "Should I book train tickets in advance?",
          "answer": "High-speed trains from major cities require reservations, but regional trains between villages operate on a hop-on, hop-off basis. Purchase your Cinque Terre Card for unlimited local travel and trail access."
        },
        {
          "question": "What about luggage storage?",
          "answer": "La Spezia Centrale station offers luggage storage (€6 per day). Most village stations have limited facilities, so travel light or arrange hotel luggage transfer services through your accommodation."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is the ferry service reliable?",
          "answer": "Coastal ferries operate April through October, weather permitting. Service from La Spezia and Portovenere offers stunning sea-level views of the villages, but can be cancelled in rough weather. Check conditions before planning ferry-dependent itineraries."
