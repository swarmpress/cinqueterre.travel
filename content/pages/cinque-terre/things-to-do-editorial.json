It is a choice of how you spend your attention. Whether you are wandering without a route, sitting on a salt-worn rock, or sharing a simple meal, you are participating in a way of life that has remained remarkably consistent despite the world's acceleration.</p>",

It acknowledges that your energy, the season, and the light will dictate what feels right at any given moment.

You will find that when you stop searching for highlights, the entire place becomes one.</p>"
