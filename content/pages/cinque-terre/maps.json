        {
          "question": "Do I need special maps or can I rely on phone apps?",
          "answer": "While smartphone apps work well in villages, cellular coverage becomes patchy on remote trail sections. Download offline maps before departing, and consider carrying a physical backup. The official Cinque Terre Park maps (available at train stations) include crucial details like emergency phone numbers and shelter locations that generic apps miss."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do trail numbers work and which should I prioritize?",
          "answer": "The park uses a numbered system: Trails 1-3 are high-altitude ridge routes requiring good fitness; Trail 2 (the famous Blue Trail) connects all five villages at sea level but has paid sections; Trails 4-12 are shorter connecting paths between main routes. Start with Trail 2 segments for your first visit, then explore numbered alternatives as you build confidence."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the best time of day to start hiking for optimal conditions?",
          "answer": "Begin coastal trails by 8:00 AM to avoid afternoon heat and crowds. Morning mist often clears by 10:00 AM, revealing spectacular views. For higher elevation trails, start even earlier (7:00 AM) as afternoon thunderstorms are common May through September. Sunset hikes work beautifully on westward sections, particularly from Corniglia to Vernazza."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are there navigation aids for people with accessibility needs?",
          "answer": "The Blue Trail between Manarola and Corniglia (Via dell'Amore) offers wheelchair access when open. Monterosso has the flattest village layout with paved waterfront paths. Train stations provide elevator access to most village centers. Contact the National Park office for current accessibility maps and assisted route options – they maintain updated guides for visitors with mobility considerations."
        },
        {
          "question": "How reliable are trail condition updates and where do I find them?",
          "answer": "Official updates appear on the Parco Nazionale delle Cinque Terre website, updated weekly during hiking season. Local tourism offices in each village post daily conditions on bulletin boards. Weather-related closures happen frequently – sempre verificare (always verify) before setting out. Rangers patrol main routes and can provide real-time conditions if you encounter them on the trail."
        },
        {
          "question": "What should I do if I get lost or disoriented on the trails?",
          "answer": "Stay calm and look for the distinctive red-and-white CAI (Club Alpino Italiano) trail markers – they appear every 50-100 meters on official routes. If you can't find markers, retrace your steps to the last one you remember. Emergency phone numbers are posted at major trail junctions. In true emergencies, call 118 (Italian emergency services) or use the SOS features on your phone even without cellular service."
