Watch as processions wind through terraced vineyards, carrying centuries-old statues blessed by Mediterranean salt air. The magic intensifies as twilight falls—lanterns flicker against pastel facades while traditional songs echo between stone walls.\n\nFrom Vernazza's underwater Christmas miracle to Corniglia's harvest bounty, these aren't tourist performances but living traditions where three generations gather, recipes are passed down, and the line between sacred and celebratory beautifully blurs. Time your visit with these festivals, and you'll witness the authentic heart of Ligurian culture beating strongest."

        {
          "question": "When are the best festivals to experience in Cinque Terre?",
          "answer": "The most spectacular celebrations occur during summer patron saint festivals (June-September), autumn harvest festivals (September-October), and the unique underwater Christmas ceremony in December. Each season offers distinct experiences, from outdoor concerts with sea views to intimate wine tastings in ancient cellars."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need reservations for festival events?",
          "answer": "Most traditional patron saint festivals and processions are free and open to all. However, special events like harvest dinners, wine tastings, and concerts often require advance booking, especially during peak summer months. We recommend securing spots for exclusive experiences 2-3 weeks ahead."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are festivals suitable for families with children?",
          "answer": "Absolutely! Many festivals are family-centered community celebrations where children play active roles. Harvest festivals include grape stomping activities, while patron saint processions create magical experiences for young ones. Evening events typically end by 10 PM, perfect for family schedules."
        },
        {
          "question": "What should I wear to participate in festivals?",
          "answer": "Dress comfortably for walking on uneven stone surfaces, with layers for temperature changes from day to evening. Religious processions appreciate modest attire. Bring comfortable walking shoes and a light jacket for evening celebrations, as coastal breezes can be cool even in summer."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I photograph festivals respectfully?",
          "answer": "During religious ceremonies, be discreet and avoid flash photography near altars or during prayers. The golden hour before sunset creates stunning light for procession photos. Ask permission before photographing locals up close, and remember that participation often yields better shots than passive observation."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I taste local specialties at festivals?",
          "answer": "Festival food is often the highlight! Each celebration features regional specialties—from Corniglia's famous torta during San Pietro to fresh seafood at summer festivals. Local wine, including the prized Sciacchetrà dessert wine, accompanies most celebrations. Many events include communal meals or food stalls with authentic preparations."
