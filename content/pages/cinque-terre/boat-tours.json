      "content": "For over six centuries, these waters have been the lifeline of the Cinque Terre. Before the railway carved through the mountains in 1874, boats were the only connection between these cliff-hugging communities and the outside world.\n\nToday's tours follow the same ancient routes used by merchants carrying wine, olive oil, and the precious anchovy catch that built these villages. Your journey reveals architectural marvels impossible to appreciate from land – the ingenious engineering that allowed entire communities to flourish on seemingly impossible terrain.\n\nFrom April through October, the Battello del Golfo provides scheduled service between villages, while private operators offer intimate experiences year-round. Spring and early autumn offer the clearest waters and most comfortable temperatures for swimming stops."

          "question": "When is the best time for boat tours?",
          "answer": "Peak season runs April through October with daily departures. For the clearest waters and fewer crowds, book in May, early June, or September. Winter tours operate on weekends with advance booking, offering dramatic storm-watching opportunities."
        },
        {
          "question": "How much should I budget for a boat tour?",
          "answer": "Shared tours start from €25 per person for basic village hopping, while sunset aperitivo cruises range €45-65. Private charters begin at €300 for up to 6 guests for half-day experiences, reaching €800-1200 for luxury full-day charters with swimming stops and gourmet lunch."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can tours operate in rough weather?",
          "answer": "Safety is paramount. Tours cancel when waves exceed 1.5 meters or during strong Libeccio winds. Operators typically offer full refunds or rescheduling. The enclosed waters near Monterosso provide shelter during mild weather, allowing modified shorter routes."
        },
        {
          "question": "What should I bring on board?",
          "answer": "Sunscreen (marine reflection intensifies UV), hat, sunglasses, and water bottle are essential. Many boats lack shade. Bring swimwear for swimming stops and a light jacket for evening cruises – Mediterranean temperatures drop quickly after sunset."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are there age restrictions or accessibility considerations?",
          "answer": "Most boats welcome all ages, though choppy conditions may be uncomfortable for very young children or those with mobility issues. Traditional wooden boats require climbing over sides to board. Modern catamarans offer easier access and more stability."
        },
        {
          "question": "Where do tours depart from?",
          "answer": "Primary departure points are Monterosso al Mare (largest harbor), La Spezia (major port), and Riomaggiore (smaller boats only). Some operators provide shuttle service from other villages. Advance booking recommended, especially for sunset cruises which sell out weeks ahead in summer."
