      "leftContent": "<p>The story begins in the <strong>terraces</strong>. Every inch of soil was earned, carved out of the rock to plant grapevines and olive trees. This is why wine here is not just a drink; it is the village's primary currency of labor. The Sciacchetrà you sip today is the same liquid gold that has sustained these families through generations of isolation.</p><p>Then there is the <strong>sea</strong>. Because the village was poor and the work was hard, the food became simple. Fish is served with little more than a squeeze of lemon and a drizzle of the oil pressed from those hillside groves. There is no need for heavy sauces when the catch was in the water three hours ago.</p>",
      "rightContent": "<p>You will notice that <strong>menus are short</strong>. This is not a lack of choice, but a commitment to the day. If the sea was rough, there is no sea bass. If the 'orto' (the garden) is between seasons, the vegetables will change. We eat what the land and sea allow, following a rhythm tied to light and weather.</p><p>Meals here follow the <strong>rhythm of work</strong>. A quick cone of fried fish at midday to keep moving, and a long, slow dinner as the sun dips behind the village—a time to reclaim the day from the crowds. To eat well here is to be receptive to these rhythms, to stop looking for variety and start looking for place.</p>"
