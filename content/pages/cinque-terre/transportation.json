For centuries, these villages were accessible only by boat or by the narrow mule tracks that crisscross the hills. Today, while modern transport has bridged the gap, the physical reality remains: Riomaggiore is a vertical world of stone and salt, where movement is measured in steps rather than kilometers.</p><p>Knowing this in advance <strong>changes your arrival</strong>. It transforms a long tunnel or a steep parking lot from a frustration into a threshold.</p>",
      "rightContent": "<p>We encourage you to <strong>arrive with patience</strong>. The train may be crowded, the parking may be distant, and the boat may be at the mercy of the waves. But each of these paths offers a different perspective on the village's character. To arrive unhurried is to begin your journey already in sync with the pace of the coast.</p><p>Once you reach the station or the parking garage, <strong>the village begins</strong>. There is no 'lobby' here—only the street, the stairs, and the immediate presence of the houses.</p>"
