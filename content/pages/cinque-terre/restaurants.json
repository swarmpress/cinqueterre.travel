The best tables often require patience - book ahead or arrive early to secure your spot overlooking the endless blue.\n\n**Must-Try Specialties:**\n- Traditional pesto made with Genovese basil DOP\n- Daily catch featuring Mediterranean anchovies and sea bass\n- Local Cinque Terre DOC wines paired with every meal\n- Focaccia col formaggio - the region's legendary cheese bread\n- Sciacchetra dessert wine with traditional canestrelli cookies"

          "question": "Do I need reservations for restaurants in Cinque Terre?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. The best restaurants fill up quickly, especially during peak season (April-October). Book at least 2-3 days ahead for fine dining establishments, and even casual trattorias appreciate advance notice. Some popular spots like Gambero Rosso in Vernazza require reservations weeks in advance during summer."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are the typical dining hours in Cinque Terre?",
          "answer": "Lunch service typically runs 12:00-15:00, with many restaurants closing in the afternoon. Dinner service begins around 19:00 and continues until 22:30. Italians dine later, so you'll find the best atmosphere after 20:00. Some restaurants close one day per week, usually Monday or Tuesday."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which local specialties should I try?",
          "answer": "Don't miss trofie al pesto (hand-rolled pasta with basil pesto), acciughe del mar Ligure (local anchovies), focaccia col formaggio from Recco, and farinata (chickpea pancake). Pair meals with Cinque Terre DOC white wine or the sweet Sciacchetra dessert wine. Fresh seafood varies daily - ask your server for the catch of the day."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the price range for dining in Cinque Terre?",
          "answer": "Expect to pay EUR15-25 for lunch at casual spots, EUR35-60 for dinner at mid-range restaurants, and EUR80-120+ per person at fine dining establishments. A glass of local wine costs EUR6-12, while full bottles range from EUR25-80. Tourist areas command premium prices, but the quality typically justifies the cost."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are there vegetarian options available?",
          "answer": "Yes, Ligurian cuisine offers excellent vegetarian dishes. Pesto pasta, farinata, focaccia varieties, and vegetable antipasti are staples. Many restaurants prepare pasta with seasonal vegetables, and the famous pesto is naturally vegetarian. However, inform restaurants of dietary restrictions when booking, as many dishes may contain anchovies or pancetta."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which village has the best restaurants?",
          "answer": "Each village offers unique dining experiences. Monterosso has the most upscale options with sea views, Vernazza offers romantic waterfront dining, Corniglia provides authentic family-run trattorias, Manarola balances scenic views with quality cuisine, and Riomaggiore features innovative takes on traditional dishes. The best choice depends on your mood and budget."
