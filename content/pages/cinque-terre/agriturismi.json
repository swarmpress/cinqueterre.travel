What you see isn't just agriculture - it's a living cathedral of human determination carved into impossible cliffs.\n\nThese *terrazzi* represent one of the world's most extreme forms of viticulture. Each narrow ledge was hewn from solid rock, then filled with soil carried up by hand. The dry-stone walls, built without mortar, flex with the seasons and allow perfect drainage for vines that produce some of Italy's most distinctive wines.\n\nWhen you dine at an agriturismo, you're not just tasting food - you're experiencing the flavors of this heroic landscape. The Bosco grapes that become aromatic white wine. The Albarola that creates crisp minerality. The rare Sciacchetra dessert wine that takes years to perfect and sells for EUR80 per bottle in Milano's finest restaurants.\n\nYour hosts will share stories passed down through generations: how their great-grandfathers carried limestone from distant quarries, how they survived the wars by trading wine for grain, how UNESCO recognition both blessed and challenged their way of life."

          "question": "When is the best time to visit agriturismi in Cinque Terre?",
          "answer": "April through October offers the fullest experience, with harvest season (September-October) being particularly magical. Spring brings wildflowers and mild temperatures, while summer offers the longest days. Many close January-March, though some offer cozy winter experiences with hearty soups and preserved foods."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I reach the hillside farms from the coastal villages?",
          "answer": "Most agriturismi provide pickup services from train stations, though many guests enjoy the 30-60 minute hike through ancient mule paths. Some farms are accessible by car via winding mountain roads. Your hosts will provide detailed directions and can arrange transportation for EUR15-25 per person."
        },
        {
          "question": "What should I expect from a typical agriturismo meal?",
          "answer": "Meals are multi-course celebrations of the farm's production: antipasti with their own olive oil and preserves, handmade pasta with wild herbs, grilled vegetables from the garden, and wine pairings. Expect 2-3 hours of leisurely dining. Prices range from EUR35-65 per person, often including unlimited house wine."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I stay overnight at agriturismi?",
          "answer": "About half offer accommodations ranging from simple rooms (EUR80-120/night) to luxury suites (EUR180-350/night). Book well ahead, especially for harvest season. Many include breakfast and offer cooking classes or guided hikes as part of multi-day packages."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do agriturismi accommodate dietary restrictions?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. Ligurian cuisine is naturally rich in vegetables, and most farms can accommodate vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free needs with advance notice. Their gardens produce incredible variety, and many pride themselves on creative plant-based dishes using wild foraged ingredients."
        },
        {
          "question": "How far in advance should I book?",
          "answer": "For day visits and meals, 3-7 days is usually sufficient, except during harvest season (September-October) when you'll want 2-3 weeks. For overnight stays, book 4-6 weeks ahead, especially for weekends. Popular experiences like truffle hunting or harvest participation fill up quickly."
