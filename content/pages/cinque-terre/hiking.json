        {
          "question": "Do I need the Cinque Terre Card for hiking?",
          "answer": "Yes, the Cinque Terre Card is required for accessing the Blue Trail (Sentiero Azzurro) sections between villages. It costs EUR7.50 per day and includes unlimited train travel between the five villages. Many inland trails remain free to access."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the best time of day to start hiking?",
          "answer": "Start between 7-8AM for the best experience. You'll enjoy cooler temperatures, perfect golden light for photography, and significantly fewer crowds. Afternoon hikes can be hot and crowded, especially in summer months."
        },
        {
          "question": "How difficult are the hiking trails?",
          "answer": "Difficulty varies greatly. The Via dell'Amore is an easy 20-minute stroll, while the Monterosso to Vernazza section involves steep climbs and rocky terrain. Each trail listing includes detailed difficulty ratings and timing estimates."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are the trails open year-round?",
          "answer": "Most coastal trails operate March through November, weather permitting. Some sections may close temporarily due to landslides or maintenance. Always check current conditions at park visitor centers before setting out."
        },
        {
          "question": "What should I bring for a day hike?",
          "answer": "Essential items include sturdy hiking shoes, 1.5L water per person, sun protection, a light jacket, and snacks. There are no water fountains along coastal sections, and weather can change quickly at higher elevations."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I hike with children?",
          "answer": "Yes, but choose trails carefully. The Via dell'Amore and village connections are family-friendly, while coastal cliff paths require supervision. The Lardarina stairs in Corniglia make an exciting challenge for adventurous kids over 8 years old."
