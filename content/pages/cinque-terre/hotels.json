Riomaggiore combines authentic village life with convenient rail connections to La Spezia.\n\n**Booking Strategy:** Reserve 3-4 months ahead for summer stays (June-August). Spring (April-May) and autumn (September-October) offer the best balance of weather, crowds, and pricing. Many properties close January-February.\n\n**Budget Considerations:** Expect premium pricing for sea views and central locations. Mid-week stays cost significantly less than weekends. Consider shoulder season for 30-40% savings without sacrificing experience quality.",

          "question": "When should I book my Cinque Terre accommodation?",
          "answer": "Book 3-4 months in advance for summer stays (June-August) and major holidays. Many of the best properties sell out early, especially those with sea views or in Vernazza and Manarola. Spring and fall bookings can be made 6-8 weeks ahead, but don't wait too long for weekend stays."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which village offers the best hotel selection?",
          "answer": "Monterosso has the most diverse range of accommodations, from luxury beachfront hotels to boutique B&Bs. It's also the only village with traditional resort amenities like spas and multiple restaurant options. However, every village has excellent options - it depends on your preferred atmosphere."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are sea view rooms worth the extra cost?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. Waking up to sunrise over the Mediterranean is transformative, and the views provide endless photo opportunities. However, village view rooms often cost 30-40% less and offer charming glimpses of local life. Consider your budget and priorities carefully."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I transport luggage to hillside properties?",
          "answer": "Many accommodations offer luggage transport services for EUR10-20 per bag, especially those requiring uphill walks. Some villages have porter services, or you can arrange transport through your hotel. Always confirm this when booking if you have heavy luggage."
        },
        {
          "question": "What amenities should I expect in different price ranges?",
          "answer": "Budget options (EUR80-120): Basic comfort, shared bathrooms possible, minimal amenities. Mid-range (EUR120-200): Private bathrooms, some with sea views, breakfast included. Luxury (EUR200+): Superior locations, premium amenities, concierge services, and exceptional views."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is air conditioning necessary year-round?",
          "answer": "Essential for summer stays (June-September) when temperatures reach 30C+ and humidity is high. Spring and fall are generally comfortable without AC, but request it if you're a warm sleeper. Many historic properties lack central air, so confirm this amenity when booking."
