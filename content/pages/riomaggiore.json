      "content": "In 1239, Greek refugees fleeing barbarian invasions discovered this sheltered cove, establishing what they called 'Rivus Major'—the major river—after the stream flowing through the valley. These early settlers built the first terraced vineyards and fishing harbors that form the foundation of today's village.\n\nBy 1260, the growing community faced Saracen raids and constructed the circular fortress that still dominates the village skyline. This medieval castle served as both watchtower and refuge, protecting families and their precious stores of wine and grain during turbulent times.\n\nThe village's artistic legacy began with painter **Telemaco Signorini** (1835-1901), whose Macchiaioli movement landscapes introduced Cinque Terre to international artistic circles. His work capturing the interplay of light and color on these coastal cliffs helped establish the region's reputation for natural beauty.\n\nIn 1997, Riomaggiore achieved its greatest recognition when UNESCO designated the entire Cinque Terre as a World Heritage Site, acknowledging these villages as an outstanding example of a harmonious interaction between people and the environment.\n\n*Cultural note: The Feast of San Lorenzo each August maintains centuries-old traditions, with processions winding through the same medieval streets walked by the village's Greek founders.*"
