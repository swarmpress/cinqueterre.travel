        "**The harbor changes everything**. While other villages launch boats from rocky beaches, Vernazza offers protected embarkation. The ancient breakwaters built by the Doria family still shelter the bay. Boarding is easier, departures smoother, and the dramatic backdrop of village and castle is unmatched.",

The experience is deliberately simple: the sound of water, the warmth of wood, the coast unfolding.",

        "**Prices reflect the experience**. Group tours start around €45 per person for 2-hour sunset cruises. Private charters range from €800-2,000 for half-day experiences depending on vessel and inclusions. Premium doesn't mean overpriced; the access and perspective justify the cost.",
        "**Combine with dining**. Many operators coordinate with harbor-side restaurants for pre-departure aperitivos at Gambero Rosso or post-tour dinners at Belforte. The timing works naturally—boats return as the restaurants begin evening service."
