          "question": "How far in advance should I book at Gambero Rosso and Belforte?",
          "answer": "For Belforte's tower terrace tables, book 2-3 weeks ahead during peak season (June-September). Gambero Rosso typically requires 3-5 days advance notice for harbor-view tables. Both restaurants accept online reservations, but calling directly often yields better table placement for special occasions."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the best time to visit Nessun Dorma for sunset photos?",
          "answer": "Arrive exactly 60 minutes before sunset to secure the coveted edge tables with unobstructed harbor views. The restaurant doesn't take reservations, so timing is everything. During summer months, this means arriving around 7:30 PM for optimal positioning."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which restaurants offer vegetarian and dietary-friendly options?",
          "answer": "Belforte offers a dedicated vegetarian tasting menu with wine pairings, while Gambero Rosso provides excellent gluten-free pasta options. Nessun Dorma serves simple vegan focaccia varieties. Always inform restaurants of dietary requirements when booking for the best experience."
        },
        {
          "question": "What should I order for my first meal in Vernazza?",
          "answer": "Start with crudo di ricciola (amberjack sashimi) at Gambero Rosso, paired with local Cinque Terre Bianco wine. For a casual experience, try fresh focaccia con stracchino at Nessun Dorma while watching the sunset. The trofie al pesto is exceptional everywhere but particularly outstanding at Gambero Rosso."

        {
          "question": "Where do I park when visiting Vernazza?",
          "answer": "Vernazza is completely car-free. Park at La Spezia Centrale (€1.20/hour) and take the regional train (12 minutes, €2.10). Alternatively, use the paid parking areas in Monterosso (20-minute train ride) or Levanto (15 minutes). Never attempt to drive into any Cinque Terre village."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I get from the train station to the harbor restaurants?",
          "answer": "The walk from Vernazza station to the harbor takes exactly 5 minutes downhill through the main pedestrian tunnel. Follow signs for 'Centro' and you'll emerge directly at Piazza Marconi where Gambero Rosso overlooks the harbor. The path is well-lit and wheelchair accessible via the main route."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the best way to reach Belforte restaurant?",
          "answer": "From the harbor, take the steep stone steps up Via del Castello toward the Doria Castle. Belforte is built into the medieval tower - look for discrete signage about 3 minutes up the climb. Wear comfortable shoes as the medieval stonework can be uneven, especially after rain."
        },
        {
          "question": "When do the last trains leave Vernazza?",
          "answer": "The final regional train typically departs around 11:45 PM to La Spezia and 11:20 PM toward Monterosso, but verify current schedules as they change seasonally. During summer months, late dining reservations are feasible, but always check return transportation when making evening plans."

          "question": "When is the best weather for dining on restaurant terraces?",
          "answer": "May through September offers consistent terrace weather, with July and August being warmest but most crowded. Late September provides ideal conditions - warm days, cool evenings, and significantly fewer crowds. Most terrace restaurants close November through March due to weather exposure."
        },
        {
          "question": "What should I pack for a day in Vernazza?",
          "answer": "Comfortable walking shoes are essential for medieval stone streets and steps to clifftop restaurants. Bring a light jacket for evening terrace dining, even in summer. Pack a small daypack for purchases, and don't forget your camera charger - Vernazza is exceptionally photogenic from every angle."
        },
        {
          "question": "How crowded does Vernazza get during peak season?",
          "answer": "July and August see the heaviest crowds, with the harbor area becoming quite congested between 11 AM and 4 PM. For the best experience, plan restaurant reservations for early lunch (12:30 PM) or later dinner (8 PM) when day-trippers have departed. Early mornings before 9 AM offer magical solitude."

        "Your Vernazza experience transforms dramatically based on timing and preparation. The village operates on a natural rhythm - early morning belongs to locals and fishing boats, midday brings the tourist rush, while evening returns Vernazza to its romantic, intimate character.",
        "For photography enthusiasts, the golden hour provides exceptional opportunities. The famous harbor view from Nessun Dorma is spectacular, but equally stunning perspectives await from the Doria Castle tower and the coastal path toward Monterosso. Professional photographers recommend visiting during shoulder seasons when dramatic weather creates more interesting light conditions.",
        "Shopping in Vernazza centers around local specialties rather than general souvenirs. Look for authentic Ligurian products: locally pressed olive oil, handmade pesto, and the distinctive Cinque Terre white wine. The small shops near the harbor square offer the highest quality regional products, though prices reflect the prime location."
