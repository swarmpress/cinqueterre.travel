        "**Reservations are essential**. This isn't optional advice. Vernazza's best restaurants fill days or weeks ahead during peak season. Belforte's tower tables require 2-3 weeks advance booking. Gambero Rosso's harbor view needs 3-5 days. Plan accordingly.",
        "**Timing determines experience**. The village transforms throughout the day. Early morning belongs to locals and fishing boats. Midday brings crowds. Evening returns Vernazza to its intimate character. Choose your timing based on what you want to experience.",
        "**The logistics are specific**. Vernazza is car-free. Completely. Park in La Spezia and take the train. The walk from station to harbor takes 5 minutes downhill through a pedestrian tunnel. Last trains leave around 11:45 PM.",
        "**The crowds are predictable**. July and August see the heaviest traffic, with the harbor area congested between 11 AM and 4 PM. Early mornings before 9 AM offer magical solitude. Evenings after 6 PM when day-trippers leave restore the village's character."

          "giuliaComment": "The reservation question I hear most: 'Is it really necessary?' Yes. Full stop. These aren't suggestions. During summer, walking in without a booking means watching others eat while you search for alternatives. Plan ahead or accept disappointment.",

Park at La Spezia Centrale (€1.20/hour) and take the regional train (12 minutes, €2.10). **Station to harbor?** 5 minutes downhill through the Via Roma pedestrian tunnel—follow signs for 'Centro.' **To reach Belforte?** From the harbor, take steep stone steps up Via del Castello toward the Doria Castle. 3 minutes of climbing. Wear comfortable shoes.",

      "content": [
        "**What makes Vernazza different from other villages?** It's the only village with a true natural harbor and the most significant medieval fortifications. Its history as a Genoese naval base created more dramatic architecture and a stronger maritime culture than its neighbors.",
        "**When is the best time for photographs?** Golden hour (45 minutes before sunset) provides the most dramatic colors. Arrive at Nessun Dorma 60-90 minutes before sunset for the best tables and lighting. Early morning (before 9 AM) offers different magic—softer light, empty streets, working harbor.",
        "**Is Vernazza accessible?** Limited accessibility due to medieval stone streets and many stairs. The harbor square and main Via Roma are relatively flat, but most restaurants and viewpoints require climbing. If mobility is a concern, ask specific questions before booking.",
        "**How do I experience local traditions?** The Feast of Santa Margherita in July features maritime processions and blessing ceremonies. Early morning harbor visits connect you to the fishing culture. Evening passeggiata lets you join the daily rhythm without understanding the language."
