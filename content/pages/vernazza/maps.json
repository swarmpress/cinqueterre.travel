      "content": "**Harbor Square Dining**: Gambero Rosso anchors Piazza Marconi with prime waterfront tables - arrive by 11:30 AM to secure harbor-view seating for lunch, or book 2-3 weeks ahead for dinner. The square's eastern corner offers the most dramatic lighting for evening photography.\n\n**Clifftop Fine Dining**: Belforte occupies an ancient tower on Via Guidoni, accessible via steep stone steps from the harbor. This Michelin-recommended establishment requires advance reservations (minimum 2-3 weeks in peak season) and offers the most romantic sunset dining in Cinque Terre.\n\n**Scenic Sunset Spots**: Nessun Dorma perches on Via Discovolo, reached by climbing the hillside steps behind the church. No reservations accepted - arrive 90 minutes before sunset for prime Instagram-worthy tables overlooking the entire village.\n\n**Navigation Tip**: Restaurant addresses can be deceiving in Vernazza's medieval layout. Use landmarks: harbor square restaurants are obvious, clifftop venues require uphill climbs, and hillside spots like Nessun Dorma are reached via stone steps marked with small signs."

      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "How do I get from the train station to the harbor?",
          "answer": "Exit the train and follow the pedestrian tunnel (Via Roma) that leads directly into the village center. The walk takes 3-4 minutes downhill and emerges at Piazza Marconi harbor square. Look for the bright daylight at the tunnel's end."
        },
        {
          "question": "Where can I find the best viewpoint for photos?",
          "answer": "The Doria Castle tower offers 360-degree views and costs €3 entry. For free viewpoints, climb to Nessun Dorma restaurant on the hillside or walk to the small cemetery above the village. The harbor breakwater also provides excellent sunrise shots."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is Vernazza wheelchair accessible?",
          "answer": "Limited accessibility due to medieval stone streets and steps. The harbor square and main Via Roma are relatively flat, but most restaurants and viewpoints require climbing stairs. The train station has an elevator, and some harbor-level dining is accessible."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I find hiking trail entrances?",
          "answer": "The Monterosso trail begins at the northern end past the harbor, marked clearly with blue trail signs. The Corniglia route starts from the southern side near the cemetery. Both require purchasing Cinque Terre park cards available at the train station."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the best route for sunset viewing?",
          "answer": "For dinner: book Belforte's corner tower table. For casual drinks: arrive at Nessun Dorma by 6 PM. For photography: climb to the castle or cemetery viewpoint. The harbor breakwater offers stunning western exposure for golden hour shots."
        },
        {
          "question": "Where can I store luggage while exploring?",
          "answer": "The train station offers official luggage storage (€6/day). Some restaurants store bags for customers, and several shops near the harbor provide informal storage services. Book ahead during peak season as storage fills quickly."
