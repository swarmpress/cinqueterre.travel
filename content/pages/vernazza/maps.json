        "**Elevation determines function**. Harbor level for fishing, commerce, and restaurants. Mid-level for housing and daily life. Upper level for defense—the castle and its sightlines. The village is organized vertically; navigation is about choosing your altitude.",

        "**Stairs are navigation**. Stone staircases connect the village's levels. The steepest lead to the best viewpoints. Comfortable shoes aren't optional; they're essential equipment for exploring Vernazza properly."

Fishing boats occupy the small harbor. Most visitors arrive here, orient themselves here, and return here throughout their visit. The square's eastern corner offers the most dramatic evening lighting for photography.",

The restaurant appears after about 3 minutes of climbing, built into the ancient tower. Look for discrete signage. **Nessun Dorma:** From behind the church, follow the hillside steps up Via Discovolo. The terrace is about 10 minutes above the harbor—look for the signs and the crowds gathering for sunset.",
          "giuliaComment": "Both clifftop destinations require climbing that some visitors underestimate. Belforte is steep but short. Nessun Dorma is longer but more gradual. Neither is accessible for those with mobility limitations. The views justify the effort—but only if you can make the effort.",

Entry costs €3 and rewards with 360-degree views from the cylindrical tower—the perspective Genoese admirals used to survey their domain. **Cemetery viewpoint:** Above the village, free and less crowded than Nessun Dorma. **Harbor breakwater:** Walk to the end for excellent sunrise shots and a water-level perspective of the village. **Coastal path to Monterosso:** The first 10 minutes offer spectacular views back toward Vernazza.",
          "giuliaComment": "The castle viewpoint is less crowded than Nessun Dorma and offers different light—morning is better here, sunset better there. The cemetery viewpoint is where locals go when they want quiet and perspective. The breakwater at sunrise shows you a Vernazza that most visitors never photograph.",
