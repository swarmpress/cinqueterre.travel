Modern amenities are integrated carefully; the medieval character is preserved.",

You'll climb significant stairs to reach home, but you'll arrive to quiet streets, local neighbors, and views that encompass the entire coast. Some upper apartments offer garden access, terraces overlooking the harbor, and the kind of peace the lower village can't provide.",

But when you're drinking morning coffee on a terrace above the tourist flow, watching the castle from a perspective most visitors never see, you'll understand the trade-off.",

Simple lunch from the alimentari. Then dinner at Gambero Rosso or Belforte—the experiences that make Vernazza's dining scene famous. You eat better, spend less, and engage with the village as a resident.",
