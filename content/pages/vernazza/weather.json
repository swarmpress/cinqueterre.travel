While many restaurants close (Belforte operates April-October only), remaining establishments like Gambero Rosso offer intimate dining experiences. Temperatures rarely drop below 45°F, and sunny winter days provide crystal-clear coastal views.",

          "question": "When is the best weather for hiking between villages?",
          "answer": "April-May and September-October offer ideal hiking conditions with temperatures between 65-75°F. Summer can be too hot (85°F+) for the exposed coastal trails, while winter rain makes paths slippery. Spring wildflowers and autumn harvest light provide stunning scenery."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the swimming season in Vernazza?",
          "answer": "Swimming is excellent June through September, with water temperatures reaching 72°F in August. Brave locals swim May through October, but visitors typically prefer July-August when both air and water are warm enough for comfortable sea access from the rocky shores."
        },
        {
          "question": "How should I dress for dinner at cliffside restaurants?",
          "answer": "Even in summer, bring a light jacket for evening dining. Clifftop locations like Belforte can be 10°F cooler due to sea breezes, and air conditioning inside medieval stone buildings runs cold. Layers are essential year-round for comfort."
        },
        {
          "question": "When do restaurants and hotels close for winter?",
          "answer": "Many establishments close November-March, with Belforte specifically operating April-October only. Gambero Rosso typically remains open year-round but may have limited hours. Always confirm seasonal schedules when booking, especially for special occasion dining."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is there a rainy season to avoid?",
          "answer": "October-December sees the most rainfall, but it's usually brief, dramatic storms rather than persistent drizzle. January-February are driest winter months. Summer rain is rare but can include spectacular lightning shows over the Ligurian Sea."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the best weather for photography?",
          "answer": "Golden hour magic happens twice daily - sunrise around 7 AM and sunset around 8 PM in summer. Spring offers wildflower foregrounds, autumn provides warm harvest light, and winter storms create dramatic seascapes. Overcast days actually enhance the village's medieval atmosphere."
