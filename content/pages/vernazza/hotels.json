        "**Harbor-Level Properties** provide the ultimate convenience. Step out your door onto Via del Santo, and you're seconds from waterfront restaurants and the harbor's morning bustle. Properties like La Mala offer this prime positioning with refined comfort, while Gianni Franzi delivers authentic charm right on the main square.",
        "**Mid-Level Accommodations** strike the perfect balance between accessibility and tranquility. Blue Marlin's nautical-themed rooms feature terraces that frame the harbor beautifully, while the hillside retreats provide vineyard views and peaceful garden settings away from summer crowds.",
        "**Clifftop Villas** represent the pinnacle of Vernazza luxury. Villa Anita commands sweeping coastal panoramas that justify every euro of the €300-600 nightly rate. These properties require a short climb but reward you with unparalleled privacy and views that will define your Italian memories."

        {
          "question": "When should I book accommodations in Vernazza?",
          "answer": "Book 3-6 months ahead for peak season (May-September). The best properties fill up quickly, especially those with harbor views. Spring and fall offer better availability and rates 30-50% lower than summer peaks, plus you'll enjoy mild weather and fewer crowds."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which areas of Vernazza are best for staying?",
          "answer": "Harbor-level properties offer maximum convenience but can be noisy during peak hours. Mid-level accommodations (like those on Via Carattino) balance accessibility with tranquility. Clifftop locations provide stunning views and privacy but require a 10-15 minute uphill walk with luggage."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do Vernazza hotels have air conditioning?",
          "answer": "Many properties lack AC due to historic building constraints, but thick stone walls keep interiors naturally cool. Properties like Villa Anita and newer apartments typically include climate control. Always confirm before booking if AC is essential for your comfort."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's included in Vernazza B&B breakfast?",
          "answer": "Expect fresh focaccia Ligure, local pastries, Italian coffee, fresh fruit, and often homemade jams. Some properties like Gianni Franzi serve breakfast on terraces with harbor views. Continental style is standard, with some hosts accommodating dietary restrictions with advance notice."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I get to my accommodation from the train station?",
          "answer": "Vernazza station sits at village level - most accommodations are within a 5-minute walk. Harbor-level properties require no climbing, while clifftop villas need a 10-15 minute uphill walk on ancient stepped streets. Many hosts offer luggage assistance or meet guests at the station."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are there luxury options beyond traditional B&Bs?",
          "answer": "Yes, Villa Anita offers villa-style luxury with full amenities, while several sea-view apartments provide modern comfort with kitchen facilities. La Mala represents the premium B&B experience with elegant rooms and prime harbor positioning. Expect €300-600 nightly for true luxury options."
