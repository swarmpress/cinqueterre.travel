Built in the 14th century, this sacred space preserves centuries of maritime devotion through its remarkable art and architecture.\n\nInside, discover precious frescoes depicting Saint Margaret of Antioch, the village's patron saint, alongside maritime ex-votos left by grateful sailors. The octagonal bell tower, visible from every approach to the village, has guided fishermen home for seven centuries.\n\nThe church's position overlooking the harbor reflects the deep connection between faith and the sea in Ligurian culture. During the annual Festa di Santa Margherita in July, the entire village gathers here for traditional blessing ceremonies that honor both the saint and the sea that sustains the community.\n\nDon't miss the remarkable wooden crucifix, carved by local artisans in the 15th century, which survived both Saracen raids and World War II bombing. The adjoining sacristy houses a collection of maritime artifacts donated by villagers, creating a unique museum of local devotion."

          "question": "What are the opening hours for Doria Castle?",
          "answer": "Doria Castle is typically open from 10:00 AM to 6:30 PM during summer months (April-October). Winter hours are reduced to 10:00 AM to 4:30 PM. Entry costs €1.50 for adults. The tower climb involves steep medieval stairs, so wear appropriate footwear."
        },

          "question": "Can I visit the Church of Santa Margherita during services?",
          "answer": "The church welcomes respectful visitors outside of service times, typically 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM. Sunday morning masses and special feast days may limit access. Photography is permitted but flash is prohibited to preserve the medieval frescoes."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the best time to photograph Vernazza's sights?",
          "answer": "Golden hour (1 hour before sunset) offers the most dramatic lighting for harbor shots from Nessun Dorma viewpoint. Early morning (7:00-9:00 AM) provides soft light and fewer crowds at the castle. For church interior photography, visit during late morning when natural light illuminates the frescoes."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are the terraced vineyards accessible to visitors?",
          "answer": "Yes, several vineyard paths are open to hikers. The Sentiero Azzurro trail passes through working vineyards with spectacular coastal views. Respect private property markers and stay on designated paths. Some local wineries offer guided tours and tastings by appointment."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long should I plan for sightseeing in Vernazza?",
          "answer": "Plan 3-4 hours to properly explore the main sights: 1 hour for the castle and tower, 30 minutes for the church, 1 hour wandering the medieval streets, and 1-2 hours at viewpoints for photography and relaxation. Add extra time if you plan to hike the vineyard terraces."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is Vernazza accessible for visitors with mobility limitations?",
          "answer": "The village center and harbor square are relatively accessible, but most historic sights involve stairs and steep paths. The castle tower requires climbing narrow medieval stairs. The church has several steps at the entrance. Consider visiting during less crowded times for easier navigation."
