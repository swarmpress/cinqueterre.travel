        "**The church breaks the rules**. Santa Margherita d'Antiochia sits at the water's edge, not above the village like most medieval churches. This placement reflects Vernazza's identity—a town built for the sea, not defended against it.",
        "**The streets hide in plain sight**. The caruggi—narrow medieval passages—climb the hillside away from the tourist flow. Here the village lives its private life, visible to anyone willing to climb past the piazza."

Its octagonal bell tower has guided fishermen home for seven centuries. Inside, maritime ex-votos hang alongside Gothic frescoes—tangible evidence of faith that has asked the sea to be merciful.",
          "giuliaComment": "Enter in the afternoon when the tour groups have gone. Let your eyes adjust to the darkness. The wooden crucifix above the altar survived Saracen raids and two world wars. That's Vernazza's faith—stubborn, survived, still here.",

This accident of geography made Vernazza the coast's commercial hub, its boats able to work when neighbors were storm-bound. The breakwater extends the protection; the piazza opens directly onto the water.",
          "giuliaComment": "Watch how the boats move here compared to Riomaggiore or Manarola. Here they float peacefully. There they must be pulled up ramps and stored. This single difference shaped everything—the wealth, the architecture, the attitude.",
