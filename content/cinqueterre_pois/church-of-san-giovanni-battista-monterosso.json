      "description_long": "The Church of San Giovanni Battista is one of the most interesting examples of Ligurian Gothic architecture in Cinque Terre. Built in the 13th century (specifically 1307), the church features a striking facade with alternating strips of white marble and green serpentine stone in the characteristic Genoese style. The bell tower was originally constructed as a defensive watch tower, part of Monterosso's medieval fortification system. The interior contains important artworks and a Baroque altar from 1744. The church stands as a testament to the village's medieval past and maritime defense history.",
