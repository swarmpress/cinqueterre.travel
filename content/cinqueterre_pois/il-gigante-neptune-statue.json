      "description_long": "Il Gigante is a massive reinforced concrete and iron sculpture representing Neptune, the Roman god of the sea. Created in 1910 by sculptor Arrigo Minerbi and engineer Levacher, it originally adorned the lavish Villa Pastine and included Neptune's trident and an enormous conch shell. Standing 14 meters high and weighing 170 tons, the statue has a dramatic history: it was partially destroyed during WWII Allied bombing that destroyed the villa, losing its arms, trident, and shell. A 1966 storm further weakened the structure. Today it appears as a weathered, romantic ruin embedded in the cliff face, evoking ancient wonders like the Colossus of Rhodes. It was restored between 2018-2022 and freed from scaffolding.",
