      "La Lanterna isn't the fanciest restaurant in town, but it's where my family goes for birthdays. The anchovies are fresh from this morning's catch, and the owner, Marco, still makes the pasta by hand.",
      "Fair warning: the steps down to Guvano Beach number over 300, and you'll feel every one on the way back up. But the secluded cove at the bottom, often empty even in August, makes the climb worthwhile."
