      "description_long": "The Church of San Giovanni Battista rises in the upper part of Riomaggiore village. Built in 1340 at the behest of Antonio Fieschi, bishop of Luni, it represents important Ligurian Gothic architecture. The original work by Antelami Masters of Lombard origin is visible in the rose window of white Carrara marble and the Gothic side doors with decorative lunettes. The church underwent major renovation in 1870 when the facade was rebuilt in Neo-Gothic style, though the original rose window was preserved. The church was extended by one span during these works. Inside, important features include a carved marble pulpit, a painted wooden crucifix, and a Renaissance triptych. The northern part of the building leans against the hillside.",
