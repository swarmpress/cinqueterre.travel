      "description_long": "The Via dell'Amore is the most iconic section of the Sentiero Azzurro (Blue Trail) and one of Italy's most famous paths. Built starting in 1920 during railway expansion work, it became a connection between two previously isolated villages. The paved path runs about 30 meters above sea level, carved directly into the cliff face. Named for its romantic setting, it became popular with young couples and features benches dedicated to mythical love deities and poets. After a devastating 2012 landslide that injured four tourists, the path underwent a €23 million restoration including rock-fall netting, new paving, handrails, lighting, and CCTV. It fully reopened in July 2024. The path offers stunning coastal views, exotic vegetation, and geological features including zoned sandstones and marine erosion patterns.",
