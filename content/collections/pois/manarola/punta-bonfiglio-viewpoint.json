This spot offers the classic postcard view of Manarola that has made it one of the most photographed locations in Italy. From here, visitors can see the pastel-colored tower houses cascading down the rocky cliff to the tiny harbor, with the Mediterranean Sea stretching to the horizon. The viewpoint includes a rest area with a kids' playground and benches, plus a popular bar (Nessun Dorma) just below. Nearby are the ruins of an old chapel once used as shelter by local farmers. The view extends west to Punta Mesco and beyond, with clear skies revealing the Maritime Alps and even Corsica. This is the quintessential Cinque Terre experience.",
