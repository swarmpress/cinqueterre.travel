The castle dates back to around the 11th century, built during the domination of the Obertenghi family. First mentioned in the 13th century, it was built as part of Vernazza's fortifications to defend against pirate attacks. The cylindrical tower in the center of the esplanade is the oldest part and was restored in the 20th century. Today, only sections of walls remain along with the impressive central tower, but the site offers breathtaking 360-degree views of the village, harbor, and Mediterranean coast.",
