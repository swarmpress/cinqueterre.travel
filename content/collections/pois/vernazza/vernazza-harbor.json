This picturesque spot features a tiny crescent of fine sand beach nestled against the colorful houses that stack up the hillside. The harbor provides breathtaking views out over the water and is framed by the imposing Doria Castle above and the distinctive octagonal bell tower of Santa Margherita di Antiochia Church. Traditional fishing boats add vibrant splashes of color to the scene, creating a fairytale backdrop. The harbor serves as the main gathering place for both locals and visitors, with cafés and restaurants lining the square. The setting is famously beautiful and helped inspire Disney's 2021 movie Luca. The small sandy beach fills up quickly in summer, but many people also sun themselves on the concrete pier and stone breakwater. The calm, shallow waters near shore make it suitable for families, while strong swimmers can venture beyond the breakwater for deeper water.",
