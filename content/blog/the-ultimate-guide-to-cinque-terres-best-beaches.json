Instead, you'll find rocky coves carved by the sea, pebble beaches tucked beneath towering cliffs, and swimming spots that require a bit of effort to reach.",

            "text": "Most beaches here are rocky or pebbly. Water shoes are essential, not optional. The water is crystalline—some of the clearest in the Mediterranean—but the entry can be challenging. The best swimming is often from the flat rocks at the edge of the sea, not from a gentle slope of sand."
