Best options: Porto Roca in Monterosso (cliff-top infinity pool), La Torretta Lodge in Manarola (tower suite with views), or Mada Charm in Vernazza (harbor views)."

They're often cheaper for groups and offer more space. Book directly with local owners when possible to support the community."

Monterosso: Best for families (beach), most restaurants, easiest access. Riomaggiore: Vibrant nightlife, good for young travelers. Corniglia: Quietest, most authentic, requires climbing stairs."
