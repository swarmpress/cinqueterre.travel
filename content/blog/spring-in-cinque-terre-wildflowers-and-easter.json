        "intro": "After the quiet of winter, Cinque Terre awakens in spring with an intensity that surprises first-time visitors. The terraced hillsides explode with wildflowers, the sea calms to Mediterranean blue, and ancient Easter traditions bring communities together. March through May offers the perfect balance of mild weather, manageable crowds, and natural beauty.",

            "title": "The Wildflower Season",
            "text": "From late March, the terraces transform into cascading gardens. Wild orchids appear first, then poppies paint the hillsides red. By April, broom bushes turn the slopes golden-yellow, their honey scent drifting across the trails. The Via dell'Amore (when open) and the Corniglia-Vernazza path offer the best flower displays. Bring a wildflower guide - over 600 species grow in the national park, many endemic to this microclimate."

            "title": "Easter in the Villages",
            "text": "Easter is the most important religious celebration in Cinque Terre. Good Friday brings solemn processions through each village - hooded penitents carrying wooden crosses, accompanied by mournful hymns. Easter Sunday transforms to joy: church bells ring continuously, families gather for lamb and torta pasqualina (spinach and egg pie), and children hunt eggs in the narrow streets. The Manarola procession is particularly moving, winding from the church down to the harbor."

            "title": "Garden and Terrace Awakening",
            "text": "Spring is when locals return to their terraces after winter dormancy. You'll see families pruning grape vines, planting basil, and repairing the dry-stone walls damaged by winter rains. The lemon trees flower in April, filling the air with citrus perfume. Many agriturismi offer spring garden tours or opportunities to help with planting - a meaningful way to connect with the land and its caretakers."

            "text": "Weather in spring is unpredictable - pack layers and a rain jacket. March can still be cool (12-16C), while May approaches summer warmth (18-23C). Trails may be muddy after rain, so waterproof hiking shoes are essential. Accommodation prices are 30-40% lower than summer, and you can often find availability on short notice. The sea is still cold for swimming (16-18C) until late May."

            "title": "Best Spring Experiences",
            "text": "Hike the high route from Soviore to Monterosso for panoramic wildflower views. Attend a village Easter mass even if you're not religious - the community atmosphere is welcoming. Visit the botanical gardens at Villa Montale in Monterosso. Book a cooking class featuring spring ingredients: fresh pesto, artichokes, and the first zucchini flowers. End your days with aperitivo watching the sun set earlier each evening as spring turns to summer."
