Expect crisp acidity, mineral notes from the sea-salt air, and flavors of citrus and white flowers. Perfect with the local seafood. Best producers: Cantina Cinque Terre, Buranco, Possa."

The result is intensely sweet, with notes of honey, apricot, and Mediterranean herbs. Only 3,000 bottles are produced annually. Expect to pay €30-50 for a small bottle—and it's worth every euro."
