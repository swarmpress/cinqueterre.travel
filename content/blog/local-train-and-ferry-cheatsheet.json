            "text": "Ferries operate March-November, weather permitting. They connect Monterosso, Vernazza, Manarola, and Riomaggiore (not Corniglia—no harbor). Single tickets cost €5-15 depending on distance. Day passes available. Ferries offer the best views of the villages from the sea—worth it even if you don't need the transport."

            "text": "Trains between 10 AM and 4 PM are packed in peak season. Either travel early morning or during dinner hours. Always have your ticket ready—inspectors are strict and fines are €50+. The last trains run around 11 PM, but verify current schedules as they change seasonally."

            "text": "Strikes happen occasionally—usually announced in advance. Bad weather can suspend both trains (flooding in tunnels) and ferries (rough seas). Have a backup plan: stay in one village and enjoy it deeply, or arrange a private boat transfer if you must move."
