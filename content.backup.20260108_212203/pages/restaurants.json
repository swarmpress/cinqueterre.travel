Every morning in Cinque Terre starts with the same intoxicating ritual—fishermen returning with silvery catches while nonne emerge from ancient kitchens, their hands already dusted with flour for the day's pasta.\n\nThis is where pesto was born, dear friends. Not in some sterile commercial kitchen, but in the sun-drenched gardens of Liguria, where basil grows so aromatic it perfumes entire neighborhoods. Here, every restaurant tells a story through food—whether it's the century-old family recipe for trofie al pesto or the innovative interpretations earning Michelin recognition.\n\nThe magic lies in the marriage of mountain and sea. Wild herbs cascade down terraced cliffs to meet the Mediterranean's bounty. Farinata—that golden chickpea pancake—sizzles in wood-fired ovens while anchovies from Monterosso are transformed into colatura, Liguria's liquid gold.\n\nBook your table for sunset, when the golden hour transforms every meal into a masterpiece. The locals dine late here—8:30 PM is early—because great food, like great wine, cannot be rushed."

          "question": "Do I need reservations for Cinque Terre restaurants?",
          "answer": "Absolutely, especially during peak season (April-October) and for dinner service. The best restaurants book weeks in advance. Even casual trattorias appreciate a call the morning of your visit. Pro tip: many restaurants close between 3-7 PM, so don't expect to walk in for an early dinner."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the typical dining schedule here?",
          "answer": "Lunch runs 12:00-3:00 PM, with many kitchens closing by 2:30 PM. Dinner starts around 7:30 PM for tourists, though locals prefer 8:30-9:00 PM. Most restaurants close one day per week and may have seasonal closures, so always check ahead."
        },
        {
          "question": "What should I expect to spend on a meal?",
          "answer": "Casual trattorias: €25-40 per person for pasta and wine. Mid-range restaurants: €50-80 per person for antipasti, main course, and wine. Fine dining establishments: €80-150 per person for full tasting experiences. Fresh seafood commands premium prices, especially whole fish."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are there vegetarian options in this seafood-focused region?",
          "answer": "Surprisingly, yes! Ligurian cuisine offers incredible vegetarian dishes—pesto pasta (ensure no fish-based sauce), farinata, focaccia col formaggio, and numerous veggie-based antipasti. Most restaurants are happy to accommodate, though always mention dietary needs when booking."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which village has the best restaurant scene?",
          "answer": "Each village offers distinct experiences: Monterosso has the most options and fine dining; Vernazza delivers unbeatable harbor views; Corniglia offers the best value with locals' favorites; Manarola balances romance with quality; Riomaggiore surprises with innovative kitchens. Try multiple villages!"
        },
        {
          "question": "When is the best time to visit for food lovers?",
          "answer": "Late spring (May-June) and early autumn (September-October) offer perfect weather, full seasonal menus, and fewer crowds. Summer brings energy but requires advance planning. Winter (November-March) sees many closures, but remaining restaurants offer intimate experiences with locals."
