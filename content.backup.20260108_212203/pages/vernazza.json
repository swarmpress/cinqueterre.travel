        "**A millennium of maritime power**. When papal records first documented Vernazza in 1080, the village was already establishing itself as a naval stronghold. The Doria family of Genoa built their cylindrical tower not for beauty, but for dominance—controlling Mediterranean trade routes from this strategic position.",

          "question": "What's the best time to visit Vernazza?",
          "answer": "May through September offers the fullest experience with all restaurants open and perfect weather for clifftop dining. April and October provide cooler temperatures and fewer crowds, though some establishments close. The golden hour before sunset transforms the harbor into pure magic - arrive at least an hour early to secure prime viewing spots."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I get the best photos of Vernazza?",
          "answer": "The classic harbor shot is taken from the breakwater rocks at water level. For the iconic elevated view, climb to Nessun Dorma restaurant or take the trail toward Monterosso for 10 minutes. Early morning (7-9 AM) offers the best light without crowds. The castle tower provides 360-degree views but requires a small entrance fee."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need reservations for restaurants?",
          "answer": "Absolutely essential for Ristorante Belforte - book 2-3 weeks ahead during peak season for their spectacular tower tables. Gambero Rosso requires advance booking for harbor-view tables. Nessun Dorma operates first-come, first-served, so arrive early for sunset spots. Even casual dining spots fill quickly during summer evenings."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I swim at Vernazza's harbor?",
          "answer": "Yes, the small rocky beach beside the harbor offers excellent swimming in crystal-clear waters. There's also a tiny pebble beach accessible via a short tunnel. The water is typically calm and perfect for photos, though facilities are minimal. Bring water shoes for the rocky areas and arrive early to claim a spot on busy days."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long should I spend exploring Vernazza?",
          "answer": "A full day allows you to explore the castle, enjoy a proper meal with views, and experience both the bustling harbor atmosphere and quiet medieval streets. Half-day visits work for photography and quick exploration, but you'll miss the magical sunset transformation. Consider staying overnight to experience the village after day-trippers depart."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the significance of Vernazza's castle?",
          "answer": "The Doria Castle represents medieval Genoa's maritime power - this cylindrical tower commanded the coast's most strategic harbor from the 11th century. Unlike decorative castles, this fortress saw real naval warfare and controlled Mediterranean trade routes. Climbing to the top connects you with centuries of sailors who watched for enemy ships from this same vantage point."
